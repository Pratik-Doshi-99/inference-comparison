While that might seem a good thing, other applications are just as important.\nRimonabant is an oral medication that works in a different way than your typical weight loss drug. Instead of blocking hunger or metabolism, Rimonabant blocks the action of a natural chemical in the brain called endocannabinoids. When you eat, endocannabinoids stimulate your appetite. By blocking the action of endocannabinoids, Rimonabant reduces appetite and promotes weight loss.\nBut here's the important part: Rimonabant is just as effective in treating a number of other conditions that are related to endocannabinoids. For example, it's being studied to treat addiction, anxiety and depression.

The \nviolence takes a pattern. It emerges in moments of crisis, when the capitalist mode \nof production predicated on the seizure of Native lands, the extraction of resources \nand the exploitation of labour fails to generate profit, threatening the individual \nworker-consumer and his imagined sense of safety, that is itself derived from the \nsecurity of his property claims. This insecurity is expressed through a violence \ndirected at those deemed \u2018alien\u2019, a figure who occupies a space of illegality and \nthreatens \u2018order\u2019, or the governance of property relations, and thus exists to be \ncontained, expelled or eliminated.2 \u2018The Chinese Must Go!\u2019 was the rallying cry \nof the \u2018working man\u2019 in the nineteenth century, a racialising and gendered figure \naspiring for inclusion into US market society. More than a negative reaction, anti\u0002Asian violence has served as a stabilising force amidst structural inequality, pro\u0002ducing a sense of belonging and shoring up the belief in capitalism and white \nsupremacy from unlikely adherents, while foreclosing other modes of relation\u0002ship not premised on the theft of labour and Indigenous lands.3 In this view, anti\u0002Asian violence recurring throughout US history should not be seen merely as \nepisodic, arising in periods of xenophobia, but rather as a structure sustaining the \nracial divides inherent in capitalism, or racial capitalism, and its twin condition, \nsettler colonialism, a system of conquest dependent upon laws, ideologies and \nother state institutions to buttress property claims on stolen land.4\n26 Race & Class 62(2)\nTo understand anti-Asian violence on these terms requires restating an unorth\u0002odox premise: Asians were not \u2018immigrants\u2019. In the nineteenth and early twenti\u0002eth centuries, Chinese, Japanese, Koreans, Filipinx and South Asians arrived in \nNorth America as a result of capitalist and imperial expansion that radically \naltered relationships within households and villages, destroyed working and \nrural people\u2019s homes and lives, and generally made those lives unliveable. A \nmore accurate term is \u2018migrant labour\u2019, which denotes Asians\u2019 sole function \nwithin capitalist economy as labour, whose value was derived from their ability \nto extract profit.5 Unable to naturalise as citizens, they were made to be mobile \nand replaceable through the enactment of laws that controlled and criminalised \ntheir social relations, and that ensured the maximisation of their labour, and not \ntheir lives. For example, the California Supreme Court in 1854 determined in \nPeople v. Hall that the race of the Chinese was \u2018not white\u2019, thereby depriving them \nof the right to testify against a white person in legal proceedings, and hence leav\u0002ing them unable to protect themselves from violence. Here, and repeatedly \nthroughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the law buttressed law\u0002less violence; the two worked in tandem to discipline Chinese labour. They also \nworked to confer value on whiteness itself, such that being white held a property \nvalue articulated over and over again in court and defended violently throughout \nthe expanding US settler empire.6   500 words   3324 char  Copy Text  Copy HTML   Export PDF   Text-Speech   Plagiarism Checker   Search Trend   Bulgarian   Chinese   Czech   Danish   Dutch   English (US)   English (UK)   Estonian   Finnish   French   German   Greek   Hungarian   Indonesian   Italian   Japanese   Latvian   Lithuanian   Polish   Portuguese    Portuguese (BZ)   Romanian   Russian   Slovak   Slovenian   Spanish   Swedish   Turkish   Ukrainian", "response": "   Vietnamese   Afrikaans   Albanian   Arabic   Armenian   Azerbaijani   Bosnian   Catalan   Croatian   Georgian   Hindi    Icelandic   Irish   Kazakh   Korean    Luxembourgish   Macedonian   Malay    Malayalam   Mongolian    Norwegian    Persian    Romanian    Serbian   Sinhala   Siswati   Tagalog    Tamil   Thai    Turkish    Welsh   Yiddish   Somali   Swahili   Albanian   Belarusian   Bengali   Bosnian   Bulgarian   Burmese   Croatian    Czech    Danish    Dutch    English (New Zealand)   English (South Africa)   Esperanto   Estonian   Faroese   French    Georgian    German    Greek    Gujarati    Haitian Creole    Hausa    Hebrew    Hindi    Hungarian    Icelandic    Igbo    Indonesian    Irish    Italian    Japanese    Javanese    Kannada    Kazakh    Khmer    Korean    Kurdish    Latin    Latvian   ", "tokens": 199, "duration": 29.170262098312378}

Put differently, violence against Asians was the means by which European \nimmigrants became Americans. The culture of violence entailed the acts, their \npublic spectacle and the casual circulation of the imagery of brutality in the form \nof postcards and snapshots.7 Lynch mobs and \u2018driving out\u2019 campaigns targeting \nChinese people were ceremonial occurrences on the US frontier. On 24 October \n1871, a mob of nearly 500 attacked Chinese residents in Los Angeles, dragging \nthem from their homes and hanging seventeen victims in what became the larg\u0002est mass lynching in US history.8 On 2 September 1885, white coal-miners at Rock \nSprings, Wyoming, killed at least twenty-eight Chinese miners, an organised bru\u0002tality that included scalping and castrating some victims before driving the rest \nof the Chinese workforce out of the camps.9 Two months later, in Tacoma, \nWashington, hundreds of armed men descended on two Chinese neighbour\u0002hoods and violently expelled all 800 to 900 Chinese residents from the city.10\nThese campaigns and sadistic rituals did more than accomplish the stated aim of \ndriving out the Chinese. They were at heart inclusionary processes for partici\u0002pants and observers to forge community in the assertion of white identity and the \nmaintenance of the colour line\nThis process extended beyond US \u2018domestic\u2019 territory. During the Philippine\u0002American War at the turn of the twentieth century, soldiers seasoned in these \ncampaigns and wars of extermination on the frontier encountered a foreign land\u0002scape they likened to \u2018Indian country\u2019 and an enemy they called\u2019. The \napplication of these terms to new peoples and places did not signal merely the \nexport of racial idioms but rather demonstrated the racialising processes at the \nheart of US imperialism, by which entire populations were made enemy and the \nmilitary\u2019s exterminist tactics justified as necessary to the \u2018civilising\u2019 mission.11\nThe seizure of distant lands and markets that resulted from the crisis of capital\u0002ism in the late nineteenth century required a violence to make \u2018Indians\u2019 out of \nnewly occupied peoples. It was a violence that regenerated whiteness and mas\u0002culinity, the fragile possessions that offered tangible forms of security in precari\u0002ous times.\nUS imperialism, scholar Dean Saranillio argues, emerges historically from \npositions of weakness, not strength. In this view, the annexation of the Philippines \nand other island territories including Hawai\u2019i, Guam, Puerto Rico, American \nSamoa and Wake Island in 1899\u20131902 secured new lands and markets for the \nUnited States in order to resolve capitalism\u2019s inherent failures.12 The \u2018fail for\u0002ward\u2019 pattern of US imperialism continued in subsequent decades. In 1924 \nCongress established the Border Patrol to further consolidate US sovereignty on \nstolen land in the Southwest and to control Mexican migrant labour that made \nthe land profitable, mobilising the promise of whiteness to motivate the force.13\nThe pattern continued in the 1940s, when the federal government reorganised \nthe nation\u2019s manufacturing, resource-extraction and knowledge industries for \nwar-making, bringing the country out of the Great Depression. The second \nworld war and the cold war ushered a permanent war economy in the United \nStates, one in which war no longer served only as the means to acquiring mar\u0002kets but became a profit enterprise itself. This economy was geared around mak\u0002ing industrial killing more efficient and wars more \u2018humane\u2019, a claim of \npreserving life that relied on the introduction of the atomic bomb and modes of \nchemical and psychological warfare developed in tandem with academic disci\u0002plines, universities and think-tanks.14\nThe expansion of racial capitalism on a global scale during this period required \na shift in the management of US racial populations. Indeed, the period from the \n1940s through the 1960s witnessed the inclusion of racial minorities into US \nnational life in unprecedented ways. Racial restrictions on citizenship and immi\u0002gration bans were lifted, allowing Chinese, Filipinx, South Asians, Japanese and \nKoreans to become naturalised citizens, and an exceptional few to enter the \nUnited States once again. And, for the first time since the end of Reconstruction \nin 1876 \u2013 which we might better think of as a failed revolution, when an experi\u0002ment in radical democracy led by Black workers after the Civil War was brutally \nreplaced with a vicious system of white supremacy under Jim Crow \u2013 the govern\u0002ment enacted civil rights laws to protect Black citizens\u2019 freedom from violence. \nRacial violence continued, to be sure, particularly directed at returning soldiers, \n28 Race & Class 62(2)\nanti-racist activists and others who transgressed the racial order, but that vio\u0002lence was seen increasingly as fringe and unsanctioned by a government that \nofficially disavowed white supremacy, now understood as a (foreign) malice and \ndetrimental to government conducts abroad.\nScholars have referred to the post-second world war period as the \u2018era of inclu\u0002sion\u2019, but this needs qualification. If we understand white supremacy not simply \nas acts of racial terror enacted by racist white people but as a structure of racial \ncapitalism, we can see this period as a continuation of the past rather than a break \nfrom it. Indeed, even as Asian Americans and African Americans enjoyed new \nfreedoms as valued \u2013 even valorised \u2013 members of the nation-state, their value \nwas derived from their participation in the permanent war economy that for \nsome included the work of killing and dying. National inclusion was premised \non the very notion that their lives were expendable in order to safeguard the free\u0002doms promised by the nation-state.

Interdisciplinary research often involves collaboration among scholars from different disciplines, but the research is still conducted within the framework of the individual disciplines. The integration of disciplines may lead to new insights or methods, but the fundamental epistemological assumptions and methodologies of the individual disciplines remain intact.\nTransdisciplinary scholarship, on the other hand, is a more radical approach that seeks to transcend the boundaries between disciplines and create new knowledge and understanding that cannot be achieved within the confines of individual disciplines.

The period also saw the renewal of labour migrations from Asia and Latin \nAmerica, facilitated by the Hart-Celler Act of 1965. The Act abolished the immi\u0002gration quota system based on \u2018national origins\u2019 and reunified families sepa\u0002rated by exclusionary policies; in broader terms, it absorbed into the United \nStates populations that were made idle or unsettled by economic policies and \nstate violence under US-backed undemocratic regimes. These outcomes, as seen \nbefore, were the result of capitalism\u2019s intrinsic unsustainability that required \ncontinual state intervention. Along with the US military defeat in the Vietnam \nWar in 1975, these compounding realities exacerbated the vulnerabilities of peo\u0002ple across race and class, including those whose identity in whiteness had reaped \nthem much of the material and ideological rewards of the preceding decades of \nthe \u2018golden age\u2019. Not coincidentally, the period witnessed a resurgence of anti\u0002Asian violence. In 1979, white fishermen in Galveston, Texas, enlisted the Ku \nKlux Klan to wage a campaign of intimidation to drive out the Vietnamese refu\u0002gees who had resettled there, viewing them as an economic, even communist, \nMan: Anti-Asian violence and US imperialism 29\nthreat, abetted by the federal government. They saw themselves as continuing a \nwar against the \u2018Viet Cong\u2019 that had been abandoned by the military and the \ngovernment, now waged on the \u2018home\u2019 front, reasserting the scripts of settler \nviolence and white supremacy.16\nAnti-Asian violence in the United States, which had never let up since the time \nAsians first entered the profit calculus in the nineteenth century, came into the US \nnational spotlight in 1982 with the brutal slaying of Vincent Chin by two Detroit \nautoworkers. On the night of 19 June, Ronald Ebens and Michael Nitz bludgeoned \nChin to death with a baseball bat after a confrontation at a night club in which \nEbens said, \u2018It\u2019s because of you little motherfuckers that we\u2019re out of work.\u2019 The \nshock of the murder was compounded by the tragic realisation that the post-civil \nrights age of colour-blindness would offer no reprieve from racism\u2019s deadly con\u0002sequences. The murder case and subsequent acquittal of the killers ignited a \ngrassroots movement led by Asian Americans calling attention to the spate of \nracially motivated hate crimes against people of Asian descent and demanding \njustice for Vincent Chin. Spearheaded by the Detroit-based group, American \nCitizens for Justice, which comprised Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Filipinx \nAmericans, the movement was deliberately pan-ethnic and crossed class lines, \nand it spanned coast to coast.17\nWhat has gone unnoticed in most historical accounts of this movement, how\u0002ever, is that many activists understood anti-Asian violence in broad terms, seeing \nit not as a result of \u2018discrimination\u2019 or \u2018scapegoating\u2019 but as symptomatic of the \ncapitalist system itself, including the violence of criminalisation and policing. \nIndeed, the spike in anti-Asian violence in the 1980s coincided with the rise of \npunitive governance in the United States that targeted a host of marginalised \npeoples, including undocumented migrants, queer and trans people of colour, \nthe workless and the houseless poor. This was the dawn of the neoliberal era, in \nwhich the government\u2019s answers to social and economic precarity was to further \ndismantle the welfare state by slashing and privatising public services, while \nramping up policing to protect the propertied class. Seen as a malignancy of dis\u0002ordered families and households and an index of crime to-be-committed, poverty \nitself became criminalised, deflecting attention away from capitalism\u2019s failures.\nGrassroots movements such as the Coalition Against Anti-Asian Violence \n(CAAAV) made these connections explicit. Founded in New York City in the \nsummer of 1986, CAAAV pulled its members from other civil rights and labour \ngroups, including Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund, Korean\u0002Americans for Social Concern, New York Asian Women\u2019s Center, the Japanese \nAmerican Citizens League \u2013 New York Chapter, among others. Observing a rise \nin hate crimes against Asians throughout the country, CAAAV sought to diag\u0002nose and tackle the problem at the roots. Its statement of purpose read: \u2018The \nrecent series of attacks on Asian Americans is neither a new phenomenon nor an \naberration in an otherwise just and peace-loving society.\u2019 Rather it is a function of \n\u2018the American economy that is based on . . . confiscated lands and 150 years of \n30 Race & Class 62(2)\ninstitutionalized slavery\u2019.18 This broad view enabled organisers to see \u2018police bru\u0002tality\u2019 as part of the organised violence of neoliberal accumulation by disposses\u0002sion. In early 1987 CAAAV won its first campaign to defend the Wong and Woo \nFamily, Chinese immigrants who were beaten by New York City police officers \nafter they had broken down the door of their Chinatown apartment and entered \nwithout warrant, arresting them for allegedly bootlegging cable television ser\u0002vices. Recognising such police conduct occurred regularly in impoverished Black \nand Brown communities \u2013 an institutionalised practice later termed as \u2018broken \nwindows policing\u2019 that criminalised the behaviours of the racialised poor \u2013 \nCAAAV organised with other \u2018Third World groups\u2019 in an effort to hold the police \nofficers accountable.19 On 28 July 1987, CAAAV mobilised 200 Chinatown resi\u0002dents to deliver a community indictment of the 5th Precinct police, condemning \nits racist violence.20\nIn its approach to organising, CAAAV built on already existing organisational \nforces set into motion through struggles that came before, specifically those that \nsought to make New York City\u2019s Chinatown a liveable place for residents. In the \nearly 1980s, in response to new zoning laws passed by the city that paved the way \nfor the construction of luxury apartments in Chinatown, the Chinese Progressive \nAssociation (CPA) organised low-income tenants to stop evictions and to fight \nfor better and more affordable housing. \u2018A dangerous trend is under way\u2019, a CPA \nHousing Committee pamphlet declared, as the government facilitated the incur\u0002sion of capital into the historic neighbourhood through urban renewal projects, \ndisplacing long-time residents and fracturing communities.21 The people fought \nback. In 1983, in response to the latest city plan to rebuild the dilapidated White \nStreet jail in the neighbourhood, thousands of Chinatown shop owners, workers, \ntenants and students descended on city hall to demand a halt to the plan. The \nprotests resulted in a major concession by the city government, the Chung Park \nProject, a three-floor building slated for senior housing and community use. As \nthe development of the project got underway, residents mobilised once again, \nthis time to push back against the developer\u2019s nefarious plans to promote real \nestate speculation and to attract corporate businesses to the space. Residents \nsigned petitions and showed up for public hearings to demand accountability to \nthe community, including keeping rents affordable to incentivise small shop\u0002keepers and making space for a day-care centre.22\nMovements against anti-Asian violence in this period were multifaceted, and \nthey were long term. Throughout the country, in Los Angeles, San Francisco, \nSeattle and New York City, these movements were struggles for affordable hous\u0002ing, health care and other basic needs, and they were sustained through collabo\u0002ration with other movements fighting for the same things, out of a shared \nrecognition that violence against any one group was a violence against others. \nThis Third World consciousness, a legacy of the global anti-colonial revolts of the \nlate 1960s, allowed activists to extend their analysis beyond the boundaries of \ntheir own communities and to draw connections to anti-racist and anti-capitalist \nMan: Anti-Asian violence and US imperialism 31\nstruggles around the world. In particular, the movement to end apartheid in \nSouth Africa in the mid-1980s mobilised many of the housing activists in New \nYork Chinatown. In June 1986, organisers from the CPA, New York Chinatown \nSenior Citizens Coalition Center, Alliance for Filipino Concerns, Young Koreans \nUnited and Japanese American Citizens League \u2013 New York Chapter formed an \nAsian contingent to march in the city-wide anti-apartheid rally. Rocky Chin of \nCPA spoke on its behalf, \u2018In [P.W.] Botha\u2019s marshall (sic) law measures, we see \nthe parallels with [Ferdinand] Marcos\u2019 regime in the Philippines and Chun Doo \nWan\u2019s repressive Korean regime.\u201923 These fascist states were not exceptional, he \ninsisted, but parts of a globe-spanning neoliberal regime rooted in histories of \ncolonialism and the economy of permanent warfare.

For while we have inherited the crisis in the form of a \ngrowing carceral state, we have also inherited a tradition of radical activism that \nset its sights on dismantling racial capitalism and imperialism and building some\u0002thing new in its wake. Today we call these forms of radical activism \u2018abolitionist\u2019, \na term applied to anti-prison organising specifically but at its core is imagining a \nsociety that does not thrive on punitive governance, and doing the slow work of \ngetting us there, pulling from already existing movements and capacities.24 An \nabolitionist framework explains why many of the movements that were activated \nin the 1980s are finding space to make their mark in the current conjuncture of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic and renewed state violence.25 CAAAV is one example. In \nthe 1990s, CAAAV shifted from anti-hate crimes advocacy to organising immi\u0002grant communities to fight for safe and affordable housing and healthcare, coun\u0002teracting the criminalisation of immigrants and organised abandonment of the \nClinton era. To mark this shift, it changed its name to CAAAV: Organizing Asian \nCommunities. In 2005 it founded the Chinatown Tenants Union to empower ten\u0002ants to fight for greater protections from predatory landlords and unjust evic\u0002tions. In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, organisers activated these \ncapacities to launch a mutual aid effort to assist vulnerable senior citizens, \ndemanding landlords repair dilapidated and unsafe housing units and clean and \ndisinfect common areas. CAAAV also joined housing justice advocates state\u0002wide in calling for rent cancellation and a moratorium on evictions.26\nThe mounting death toll from the pandemic and the crackdown on protests \nthroughout the country in response to the police murders of George Floyd, \nBreonna Taylor, Tony McDade, Rayshard Brooks and many more Black people \nlays bare the violence of a system that cares for profit over people. Asian American \nactivist groups formed in the time of neoliberal multiculturalism have been \namong those on the front lines combating the government\u2019s deadly negligence \n32 Race & Class 62(2)\nand racist violence. At a time when civil rights advocates were condemning \nDonald Trump\u2019s racist rhetoric and the spike in hate crimes against Asians, some \nare reminding us yet again that \u2018anti-Asian violence\u2019 has deep roots. They see the \nracism of the Donald Trump administration as part of the calculated cruelty of \nthe United States itself, linking the COVID-19 pandemic to the violence of US \nempire. Nodutdol is one such organisation. Formed in 1999 among diasporic \nKoreans in New York City united by a struggle to end war and militarism on the \nKorean peninsula and in the United States, Nodutdol called for the lifting of \nUS-backed sanctions that prevented life-saving medical equipment from entering \nNorth Korea, Venezuela, Iran and other countries. The pandemic has not slowed \nthe US drive to build borders, prisons and other war infrastructures, its organis\u0002ers noted. The struggle therefore must be expansive. Its statement on COVID-19 \nread: \u2018We encourage collective struggle and solidarity, as the capitalist system \ncollapses, to provide relief for the unhoused, the incarcerated, the unemployed, \nthe undocumented, the immune-compromised, the uninsured, and for all work\u0002ers in the US and around the world.\u201927 The slow work of dismantling US imperial\u0002ism calls for the implementation of radical forms of aid as well as the eradication \nof anti-Black racism, which requires nothing short of efforts \u2018to abolish police and \nprisons and to undo the United States for our collective liberation\u2019.28\nThis is ultimately why the fight against anti-Asian violence is one with the \nstruggle for all Black lives. In New York City, Seattle, Los Angeles, and other cit\u0002ies throughout the United States ravaged by the COVID-19 pandemic and by the \nviolence of capitalism, groups are uniting and fighting for the lives of those left to \ndie. Alongside demands to defund and dismantle the police, people are model\u0002ling other ways of living through mutual aid and practices of transformative jus\u0002tice.

Jones Enterprises installs cellular towers in remote locations throughout the United States and Canada. The company was so successful that it went public two years ago. Mary Jones owns substantial amounts of stock in the company and Tom Jones works at home restoring antique furniture.\n\nThey have been separated for six months after Ms. Jones found Tom in bed, with Rita Amloose, a girl that Tom met on an internet dating site. Mary was angry and started screaming at Tom. He got out of bed, lightly pushed Mary against the wall and she sustained a bloody lip. Upon hearing the shouting, the neighbors called the police to the scene. \nTom has not been convicted and remains out on bail. Tom's mother bailed him out of jail\n\nwith $50,000. in cash that was obtained from a Western Union wire transfer withdrawn from\n\nMary and Tom's joint checking account. Mary did not specifically authorize the transaction\n\nand found from her bank that Tom authorized the wire transfer. She was furious but could not do much. Mary continued living in the marital home and using the summer home\n\nas a weekend retreat. Mary has retained Robert Shrewd, the toughest most expensive divorce lawyer, in the state. Tom has retained a young wannabe hot shot Vincent Lovelost. Mr. Shrewd instituted a divorce proceeding alleging the grounds of adultery, and cruel and abusive treatment, and seeking custody of their children, child support, and alimony, and division of their property. A separation agreement was drawn up by Mary's lawyer Mr. Shrewd.\n\nBut the two lawyers were unable to reach an accord on anything. Tom's lawyer. Mr. Lovelost, told his client to hold out for a greater share of the marital wealth. Mr. Lovelost was so zealous in his representation that he kept filing motion after motion over one ridiculous thing after another. Finally, the Judge was so annoyed that he appointed a neutral mediator. The mediator was instructed to try to hash out an agreement within three weeks or the issues would have to be litigated by both parties.\n\nTom was living with his mother and the kids were living with Mary and seeing Tom once per month. The situation was very uneasy as Tom wanted to see the kids more often and Tom's lawyer sent Mary's lawyers letters on a daily basis regarding the case. But Mary expressed to her lawyer she did not want Tom to be with the kids if he was a rapist. Mr. Shrewd told Mary that he would petition the court so that Tom could only have supervised visits with the children.\n\nThere is currently no formal agreement relative to the monthly household expenses and everything is being paid for as follows out of Mary's salary and the joint checking account. The joint checking account had contained $100,000 in it and is now almost depleted. Mary was advised by her attorney not to replenish the account. Tom carns $50,000 gross per year refurbishing antique furniture.\nHis after-tax take home pay is around $2,600 monthly. Tom owns $200,000 worth of stock that he inherited. Mary earns $400,000 a year, gross from her corporation. Her after-tax take home pay is around $22,000 per month. Mary owns a rather substantial portfolio of stocks worth $500,000, 60% of which she acquired prior to the marriage. The remaining 40% of stock worth $200,000 was acquired after the marriage when her company went public. The stocks that Mary inherited are solely in her name and produced income of about $43,000 in dividends. The total value of Mary's stock in her corporation is over $1,500,000. When they separated, Mary and Tom had the joint checking account and a joint savings account with $200,000 in it.

This step is necessary because data replication is not always perfect, and small discrepancies can occur due to various reasons such as network errors, timing differences, and data corruption.\nHere are some ways to compare the data:\n1.  **Checksum verification**: The checksum is a digital fingerprint of the data. You can use the checksum to verify if the data on both servers matches.

{"timestamp": 1737622922.3877835, "datetime": "2025-01-23T09:02:02.387784", "prompt": "2 / 2Given the FAQ below, I would like to generate a knowledge graph from it. Can you provide me the steps to do it?\n\nQ. What is \u201cPay with Miles/Mix Miles and Cash\u201d?\nA. \u201cPay with Miles\u201d (PwM)/Mix Miles with Cash is the project enabling KrisFlyer (KF) members to use their KF miles as payment or partial payment of their commercial tickets and selected ancillaries on singaporeair.com (SAA).\nQ. How will this payment method benefits KF members?\nA, Members will be able to use this payment option for all commercial booking classes available on SAA, which means that they will have access to all available seats on all flights operated by SIA. Members will also have control over the number of miles they want to use, as long as it is more than the minimum required. Members will have more opportunities to use their miles before expiry. \nQ. What is the minimum number of miles required to pay for a commercial ticket?\nA. A minimum of approximately 1050 KF miles is required per transaction (i.e., per PNR). This minimum may vary as the conversion rate from SGD to KF miles is subject to change upon review. For information only: The conversion rate is stored as SGD 1: 105 KF miles, hence the KF miles deducted for such a transaction will always be in multiples of 105 miles.\nQ. Is there a maximum number of miles which is allowed to be used?\nA. No, members can pay up to 100% of the commercial ticket using miles (inclusive of airport taxes and surcharges).\nQ. If members do not have enough miles, can they purchase miles to pay for tickets?\nA. No, purchase of miles is only available when redeeming award tickets or flight upgrades.\nQ. Will members be able to use their miles to pay for taxes and surcharges on their commercial tickets?\nA. Yes, members will be able to use their miles to pay for airport taxes and surcharges of their commercial tickets bought on SAA. \nIn other words, the entire commercial ticket can be paid for with miles.\nQ. Can members use their miles to pay for the tickets of their friends and family?\nA. Members can use their miles to pay for the commercial tickets of their nominees (RGN) only. Members can nominate up to a maximum of 5 RGNs. Nominees can be added at any time. However, once added, these RGNs cannot be removed or changed for a period of 6 months and a fee is applicable.\nQ. Can members use their miles to pay for flights on another airline?\nA. No, members are only able to use their miles for SIA operated flights. If members were to purchase an itinerary on SAA which includes a codeshare flight operated by another airline, they would also be unable to use KF miles to pay for the SIA operated flight within that itinerary.\nQ. Can members use KF miles to pay for a booking made through a travel agent?\nA. No, the KF miles payment option is only available for KF members via SAA. \nQ. For transactions in foreign currencies, would the cash component be rounded up or down? Would it be rounded off to the nearest dollar?\nA. Itineraries originating from outside Singapore will be priced in local currencies (as per current SAA logic), and the local fares will be converted to SGD (based on the IATA rounding logic) before being converted to KF miles. \nQ. What is the SGD to miles conversion rate?\nA. The current conversion rate is SGD1per 105 KF miles. This rate will be reviewed periodically and is subject to change. \nQ. Will the SGD to miles conversion rate be made known to members?\nA. The conversion rate will not be explicitly made known to members on SAA (both on the content pages and the booking flow). However, if members were to enquire about the conversion rate or about the monetary value of the miles in their accounts, you can share that the conversion rate is currently SGD1 per 105 KF miles. Members can then work out the value of their miles and the amount they wish to use. Please note that this conversion rate will be reviewed periodically and is subject to change. \nQ. Will members be able to accrue PPS Value, Elite miles and KF miles if they use their miles as payment for their commercial ticket?\nA. Yes, KrisFlyer and Elite miles will be earned, in proportion to the fare (excluding airport taxes) paid using credit/debit card if the fare is mileage accruable. The PPS Value accrued will similarly be derived from the proportion paid using credit/debit card. The current conditions for accruing and calculating PPS Value still apply. As a result of this logic, the KF miles used to pay for a transaction will first be used to offset all the airport taxes of all the tickets before being used to offset the fare and fuel surcharges of the tickets. Please note that Elite miles and KF miles accrued on tickets that are partially paid for using KF miles can only be accrued to KF account. The miles accrued on such tickets cannot be parked with any other OFFPs.\nQ. Will members be able to opt to accrue miles for other KF members before themselves?\nA. No, we have optimized the accruals to benefit the principal member (the member who has used his/her miles to purchase the tickets). Members will not be able to adjust this logic.\nQ. Can members accrue miles to OFFP accounts?\nA. No, the miles earned from a commercial ticket paid for with KF miles can only be credited to their KF accounts. \nQ. Are these tickets subject to any special conditions?\nA. Yes, commercial tickets paid for with KF miles are strictly non-endorsable, even if the purchased fare is one which is fully endorsable. Other than that, the prevailing commercial conditions associated with the fare paid will be applicable.\nQ. Are redemption upgrades allowed for tickets that are paid for with KF miles?\nA. Yes, redemption upgrades are allowed for tickets that are paid for with KF miles as long as the commercial fare is in an upgradeable booking class.\nQ. Will members be able to make changes to their tickets paid for with KF miles on SAA?\nA. For flight or itinerary changes, members will have to contact their local SIA office or call centres. Any additional collection resulting from these changes can only be paid for using credit card/debit card/cash. Fare conditions will apply. Members will be able to submit their request for booking changes via SAA which will be routed offline for handling. These requests will be routed based on the POS for that transaction. For seat and meal requests, members will be able to self-service on SAA. \nQ. Can a ticket paid for with KF miles be issued by AROs/call centres?\nA. Offline assistance is to be provided to the passenger for exceptional handling only.\nQ. How do we service a customer when SAA is down?\nA. This payment feature is only available on SAA. As a result, if SAA is down, KF miles will not be an available payment option at that time. Member will be able to continue to complete the transaction offline, but payment must be made using credit/debit card. \nQ. Will members be able to go back onto SAA to do seat and meal requests after their bookings are reissued offline?\nA. Yes, as per all commercial tickets, members can make seat and meal requests on SAA for their tickets paid for with KF miles even if they have been reissued offline by AROs/call centres. \nQ. Can tickets paid for with KF miles be refunded on SAA?\nA. Yes, as per all other commercial tickets, tickets paid for with KF miles can be submitted for refunds on SAA if the tickets are completely unflown and have not been reissued. The maximum amount paid using credit/debit card will be refunded to members first (not exceeding the original amount paid using credit/debit card). The balance will then be refunded accordingly in miles. KF miles that have expired, will not be refunded.\nQ. How will the refund be handled for cancellations of a ticket paid for with miles?\nA. If refunds are applicable, then the maximum possible amount of the fare paid using credit/debit card (but not more than the original amount paid using credit/debit card) will be refunded first. The remaining refund amount, if any, will be returned in equivalent miles. In other words, we will always refund the \u201ccash\u201d amount first (not exceeding the original amount paid using credit/debit card), before refunding the KF miles. This logic also applies to the refund of residual value when a ticket is reissued from a higher fare to a lower fare. KF miles that have expired, will not be refunded.\nQ. Will residual miles be refunded for reissuance from higher fares to lower fares?\nA. For a booking change from a higher fare to a lower fare, the refund logic will apply to the residual value. In other words, we will always refund the \u201ccash\u201d amount first (not exceeding the original amount paid using credit/debit card). Any balance refund amount will then be refunded in miles. KF miles that have expired will not be refunded.\nQ. What happens if some miles used to pay for the flight have already expired at the point of refund?\nA. The expired miles will not be refunded. Only miles which have not expired can be refunded. Any applicable fees and charges associated with the refund will be deducted from the oldest miles used for the ticket. I.e., Expired miles will be used to deduct such charges first. \nQ. How can we verify whether the miles the member used to pay for the flight have already expired?\nA. Information on the expiry of the miles used for tickets is available in the transaction record in MARMS. Alternatively, once the refund mask has been created in Altea, the information is displayed as a response from MARMS. Members will also be advised of this if they submit their tickets for refund on SAA. \nQ. How can members submit their tickets paid for with miles for refund?\nA. Members can either submit their tickets for refund on SAA or they may contact their nearest SIA office to do so. For tickets submitted for refund offline, these tickets must be refunded by the original issue station. \nQ. When will the miles be credited back to members\u2019 accounts when they submit their tickets paid for with miles for refund?\nA. The miles will be returned to members\u2019 account immediately once the refund is successfully completed. \nQ. If members have purchased a commercial ticket paid fully with credit/debit card, will they be able to use miles to pay for any additional collection resulting from a reissuance?\nA. No, this new payment option is only available on SAA for new ticket issuance. \nQ. Will members be able to use their miles to pay for any other services available on SAA?\nA. No, KF miles are only available as a payment method for commercial tickets. We are working on increasing the list of SIA services members can use their KF miles to pay for. \nQ. Can members use their miles to pay for the taxes and surcharges on their redemption award tickets?\nA. No, members can only use their miles to pay for commercial bookings (including taxes and surcharges) made on SAA. We are working on enabling members to pay for taxes and surcharges on their redemption tickets in the next phase of development.\nQ. When can members use their KF miles to pay for taxes and surcharges on their redemption tickets or for any other SIA services?\nA. We are working on enabling members to use their miles to pay for (i) taxes and surcharges on their redemption tickets and (ii) other SIA services. This will be in the next phase of development.\nQ. Will OFFP members (e.g., LH Miles & More member using LH miles) be able to use their own miles from their respective FFP programmes if they are not KF members?\nA. No, only KF miles can be used for this new payment option. Hence, only KF members (who accrue KF miles) will be able to use this payment option. \nQ. Can member continue to use their KF miles to redeem Saver, Standard and Full Award tickets?\nA. Yes, we will continue to maintain the current redemption options for members. This is an additional programme feature which will increase the number of options for members to make use of their miles.\nQ. Is it better to use KF miles to pay for a commercial ticket or redeem an award ticket?\nA. The number of miles required to pay for a commercial ticket depends on the fares available at the time of purchase. Customers are advised to check the mileage requirement for both the commercial ticket and the Award redemption, as well as to consider the applicable fare conditions before deciding which ticket type is more suitable for their purpose.\nQ. Will members be able to pay for an infant ticket with miles?\nA. Currently, infant nominees are not available in the dropdown list on SAA. However, once this feature is made available on the commercial booking flow, members will be able to pay for their infant tickets with miles.\nQ. Will members be able to make a booking for himself and/or his nominees and other passengers who are not his nominees?\nA. Yes, however, members will only be able to use their miles to pay for the tickets for themselves and their nominees. They will have pay for the tickets of any other passengers using credit/debit card. \nQ. For tickets paid for with miles with itineraries starting from MI destinations, will MI be able to service (reissue/revalidate/refund) these tickets?\nA. No, as these tickets involve the collection of miles, they will have to be routed to SQ for handling. This is similar to the handling of redemption tickets. \nQ. When voiding a reissue of a ticket originally paid for with miles, the FOP for the reissue must be deleted before attempting another reissue. Why is this so?\nA. MARMs will return an approval code for all reissue ticket and this approval code is appended into the FOP field. When the reissue ticket is voided, a void message is sent to MARMs and the approval code will be invalidated by MARMS. Hence, if the FOP is not deleted, Altea will use the same approval code to issue the new ticket and this new ticket number will not be updated by MARMS. Subsequent servicing such as reissue or refund will fail since MARMS has no record of this new ticket.\nQ. Why is voiding the refund of a ticket originally paid for with miles not allowed even when sales report is not closed yet?\nA. Like a redemption ticket, Altea does not send any void message to MARMs for voiding of a refund record for tickets originally paid with miles.  Hence, MARMs will not be aware that the refund is voided and subsequent attempt to refund the ET will fail.\nQ. How can members submit their tickets paid for with miles for refund?\nA. Members can either submit their tickets for refund on SAA or they may contact their nearest SIA office to do so. For tickets submitted for refund offline, these tickets must be refunded by the original issue station. \nQ. Why must refund of tickets, which has been paid with miles, always be refunded by original issue station?\nA. If refund is done by a different station, BBR will be used to convert refundable amount to the refund station currency. However, MARMS only stores IATA exchange rate. Hence, there is a possibility that the converted amount using BBR may be higher that the converted rate by MARMS, thus resulting in refund failure. \nQ. For tickets paid for with miles, cover refund is permitted for a flown ticket but not an already refunded ticket. Why is this so?\nA. Altea will make a call to MARMs for all refund of tickets which has been paid for with miles. MARMs will have a record that the ticket is already refunded, hence further refund will not be allowed. MARMS has no record that the ticket is flown, hence cover refund is still allowed for flown ticket.\nQ. Zero refund is not allowed for tickets paid for with miles. Why is this so?\nA. MARMS expects to receive the FOP details for tickets paid for with miles in the refund message from Altea. However, there is no FOP for zero refund, hence zero refund is not allowed for ticket, which has been paid with miles. For reissue of tickets paid for with miles, only cash is allowed if additional fare is required.  Why is FQTR still a mandatory element for such reissues and also reissue without adc as well? MARMS need the FQTR number from Altea in order to create the MARMs record for the reissue transaction.\nQ. If the member wants to use 100% of the miles for his own ticket only, can he select \"Not a nominee\" in the passenger details and manually type in his RGN's details?\nA. The logic for accruals has been defaulted to always favour the principal member. The principal member will always accrue full miles before the nominee (also a KF member) accrues any miles. In the event the principal member would like to use miles to pay for his own ticket and not his nominee, he may choose not to select his nominee from the dropdown list. Instead, he could choose 'Not a nominee' and enter the 2nd pax details manually, he will not be able to use miles for this 2nd pax. In this case, the principal member will get either partial/no accrual while pax 2 will get full accrual. \nQ. Why a residual value eMD, that is issued against a ticket paid for with miles, cannot be reissued into another ET or eMD? \nA. Such reissue is not in scope for phase 1.  MARMs will return an error message to Altea and reissue will fail.  Hence, the eMD must be submitted for refund. This will be reviewed by LMD in phase 2.", "response": " \nQ. Can a ticket paid for with miles be issued as an eMD with an expired date?\nA. No, an eMD issued against a ticket paid for with miles can only be valid for 6 months from the date of issuance.  Such an eMD cannot be extended if it expires before the ticket travel date.  Hence, the ticket must be submitted for refund. This will be reviewed by LMD in phase 2. \nQ. Can the residual value eMD be revalidated if the ticket travel date is extended?\nA. No, such revalidation is not in scope for phase 1. The residual value eMD will not be revalidated. The eMD must be submitted for refund. This will be reviewed by LDM in phase 2. \nQ. Can a ticket paid for with miles be revalidated if the ticket travel date is extended?\nA. No, such revalidation is not in scope for phase 1. The ticket must be submitted", "tokens": 200, "duration": 32.46729636192322}

The data in infile should\nbe in encrypted in blocks. Why not encrypt the entire file? Because of n. We are working modulo n,\nwhich means that the value of the block of data we are encrypting must be strictly less than n. We have\ntwo additional restrictions on the values of the blocks we encrypt:\n1. The value of a block cannot be 0: E(0) \u00b4 0 \u00b4 0n (mod n).\n2. The value of a block cannot be 1. E(1) \u00b4 1 \u00b4 1n (mod n).\nA solution to these additional restrictions is to simply prepend a single byte to the front of the block we\nwant to encrypt. The value of the prepended byte will be 0xFF. This solution is not unlike the padding\nschemes such as PKCS and OAEP used in modern constructions of RSA. To encrypt a file, follow these\nsteps:\n1. Calculate the block size k. This should be k=(log2(sqrt(n)-1))/8.\n\n2. Dynamically allocate an array that can hold k bytes. This array should be of type (uint8_t *) and\nwill serve as the block.\n3. Set the zeroth byte of the block to 0xFF. This effectively prepends the workaround byte that we\nneed.\n4. While there are still unprocessed bytes in infile:\n(a) Read at most k-1 bytes in from infile, and let j be the number of bytes actually read. Place\nthe read bytes into the allocated block starting from index 1 so as to not overwrite the 0xFF.\n(b) Using mpz_import(), convert the read bytes, including the prepended 0xFF into an mpz_t\nm.

Dynamically allocate an array that can hold k = (log2(sqrt(n)-1))/8 bytes. This array should be of\ntype (uint8_t *) and will serve as the block.\n\u2022 We need to ensure that our buffer is able to hold at least the number of bits that were used\nduring the enryption process. In this context we don\u2019t know the value of n, but we can overestimate\nthe number of bits in sqrt(n) using pq.\n\nlog2 (sqrt(n)) < log2 (pq) \n\n\n2. Iterating over the lines in infile:\n(a) Scan in a hexstring, saving the hexstring as a mpz_t c. Remember, each block is written as a\nhexstring with a trailing newline when encrypting a file.\n(b) First decrypt c back into its original value m. Then using mpz_export(), convert m back into\nbytes, storing them in the allocated block. Let j be the number of bytes actually converted.\nYou willwant to set the order parameter of mpz_export() to 1 for most significant word first,\n1 for the endian parameter, and 0 for the nails parameter.\n(c) Write out j-1 bytes starting from index 1 of the block to outfile.

They were primarily concerned with understanding the world as it actually is, rather than how it ought to be. The Realists believed that knowledge of the world could be discovered through the scientific method, rather than through intuition or revelation. They taught that the world is independent of human perception, that individuals have free will, and that there is a natural order to the universe. They also emphasized the importance of empirical observation, the use of logic, and the rejection of metaphysics. The work of the Realists had a significant impact on the fields of philosophy, political science, and sociology, and continue to shape contemporary thinking on these subjects.In 120 words, Explain the difference between spontaneous and deliberate tradition.Spontaneous tradition refers to cultural practices, customs, and beliefs that are passed down through generations without the intervention of formal institutions. This type of tradition is often informal and unsystematic, and is passed on through daily interactions and activities within families, communities, and social groups. Spontaneous tradition is a product of the collective and unconscious actions of individuals, and is shaped by historical, social, and economic conditions.Deliberate tradition, on the other hand, refers to cultural practices, customs, and beliefs that are passed down through formal institutions such as religious organizations, schools, and governments. This type of tradition is often formal and systematic, and is passed on through organized education and training.

He would be a mighty warrior who would destroy the other bugbear clans - the clans that long mocked the small Karab Clan as weak dung beetle worshippers! The excitement was short-lived, however, as it was soon obvious that the child was both scrawny and frail. So, Keleg ordered that the child be tied and tossed into the the clan's sacred cave as an offering to Karab. S'Karab's mother and high priestess of the clan were the only who stayed to perform the rites and watch the child be carried into the dark cave on the backs of thousands of iridescent black beetles...\n[9:42 AM]\nMany years passed, and the clan diminished to but a few after Keleg and most of the clan's warriors fell in a mighty battle with a rival clan. Had Karab turned its back on them?\n[9:42 AM]\nThen, one night while at the now paltry Karab Clan communal fire, an unknown bugbear approached out of the dark night. He was tall but very lean, with shiny black fur and iridescent eyes that shimmered in the firelight. A large iridescent black talisman of Karab was woven into the fur on his chest. A cloak of more iridescent black shells was braided into his shoulders, and foot wrappings of the same braided over his feet. Even more iridescent black shells seemed to be embedded directly into his arms and legs. The avatar of Karab was not sacrificed that night many years ago - he was reborn! For 20 years, S'Karab meditated and communed with Karab where he learned to hunt, fight, and merge with both the power of the beetle and the power of his astral self. Unfortunately, Karab was light on speech training and so it took S'Karab a while to communicate instructions to his clan.

S'Karab listened intently, and in return, whispered something to Azrab. The elder's eyes widened, and he bowed low, indicating that he understood the plan. With a wave of his staff, he began to chant and dance towards the cave where S'Karab was to be reborn.

Correct it Please if there is something wrong or something better.\n\nAs a society continues to evolve, the issues regarding social media has become increasingly relevant. However, this essay argues that social media can still have advantages particularly in the realm of education (or learning). The author doesn't argue that we should go back to online learning modality but rather argue that it can be a helpful tool for learning.\n\nThe essay argues that social media can be an effective tool for students to gather information for research and to access additional information about their studies. It acknowledges that social media can be a convenient and efficient source of information. Despite that, the essay also recognizes that social media can also feed too much information to users, and some of it may be inappropriate for students. Finally, it emphasizes that learners must have discipline to use social media as a learning tool.\n\nThis essay provides a good overview of the advantages and disadvantages of using social media as a tool for learning. However, to make it more effective, there are some areas that need improvement. Firstly, the thesis statement needs to be more specific and detailed. While it mentions that social media can be used for learning, it fails to provide any additional information about the argument or the points that will be made in the essay. Therefore, a clear and concise thesis statement must be added to the end of the introductory paragraph to give readers a better idea of what to expect from the essay. Secondly, the essay lacks a clear and organized structure. It jumps between different ideas and points without always relating them to the main argument. A more focused approach with each paragraph clearly linked to the thesis statement would improve the essay's coherence and make it easier to follow. Thirdly, the writer makes some good points about social media's advantages and disadvantages in learning, but these arguments need to be supported with data and specific examples. This would strengthen the arguments and make the essay more persuasive. Lastly, the conclusion should be more impactful by summarizing the main points, restating the thesis statement, and providing actionable recommendations for using social media as a tool for learning. By making these improvements, the essay would be more persuasive and effective in presenting the pros and cons of using social media for learning.\n\nTo conclude, this essay provides insightful perspectives on the advantages and disadvantages of using social media for learning. To enhance the clarity and impact of its arguments, the essay would benefit from a clearer and more concise thesis statement, a more organized structure, and the inclusion of supporting evidence and data. Furthermore, a stronger conclusion that summarizes the key points and provides actionable recommendations would strengthen the overall effectiveness of the essay. By addressing these areas of improvement, the essay could become a more convincing and influential piece of writing.\n", "response": "____________________________________________________________________\nI am ready to revise and correct my essay.

Multiple servers can be set up to distribute the load and provide high availability.\n2. **Client**: The client is the application or library that communicates with the Memcached server to store and retrieve cache data.\n3. **Cache Objects**: Cache objects are the data stored in the Memcached server, which can be anything from simple key-value pairs to complex data structures.\n\n**How Memcached Works:**\n\n1. **Cache Request**: When a client requests data that is likely to be frequently accessed, the client sends a request to the Memcached server to store or retrieve the data.\n2. **Cache Lookup**: The Memcached server checks its cache to see if the requested data", "tokens": 200, "duration": 33.42831349372864}

The author doesn't argue that we should go back to online learning modality but rather argue that it can be a helpful tool for learning.\n\nThe essay argues that social media can be an effective tool for students to gather information for research and to access additional information about their studies. It acknowledges that social media can be a convenient and efficient source of information. Despite that, the essay also recognizes that social media can also feed too much information to users, and some of it may be inappropriate for students. Finally, it emphasizes that learners must have discipline to use social media as a learning tool.\n\nThis essay provides a good overview of the advantages and disadvantages of using social media as a tool for learning. However, to make it more effective, there are some areas that need improvement. Firstly, the thesis statement needs to be more specific and detailed. While it mentions that social media can be used for learning, it fails to provide any additional information about the argument or the points that will be made in the essay. Therefore, a clear and concise thesis statement must be added to the end of the introductory paragraph to give readers a better idea of what to expect from the essay. Secondly, the essay lacks a clear and organized structure. It jumps between different ideas and points without always relating them to the main argument. A more focused approach with each paragraph clearly linked to the thesis statement would improve the essay's coherence and make it easier to follow. Thirdly, the writer makes some good points about social media's advantages and disadvantages in learning, but these arguments need to be supported with data and specific examples. This would strengthen the arguments and make the essay more persuasive. Lastly, the conclusion should be more impactful by summarizing the main points, restating the thesis statement, and providing actionable recommendations for using social media as a tool for learning. By making these improvements, the essay would be more persuasive and effective in presenting the pros and cons of using social media for learning.\n\nTo conclude, this essay provides insightful perspectives on the advantages and disadvantages of using social media for learning. To enhance the clarity and impact of its arguments, the essay would benefit from a clearer and more concise thesis statement, a more organized structure, and the inclusion of supporting evidence and data.

This is why we believe that this is the problem that we must tackle and assist individuals with visual impairments so that they can walk around any place they desire in comfort. Technologies have grown swiftly, and computer vision has been an industry that has evolved rapidly too. By applying deep learning models to computer vision, we can only detect objects in front of us using a camera. However, more than just identifying them is needed to help visually impaired individuals. We must detect them quickly and precisely to let visually impaired individuals analyse the situation and act accordingly. So this is why picking the proper model for this project is highly critical since the object detection processing time must be fast and also be able to process in real time. To find the proper model for this project, we will have to research and compare the models often used in computer vision.\n2.1.\tEye care, vision impairment and blindness\n\tVision is essential for humans to undertake daily activities such as navigation and item or person recognition. Without it, it would be difficult for individuals to navigate safely, so we should always care for our eyes. According to the World Health Organisation, long-lived individuals will have at least one eye problem over their lifespan. The 2018 International Classification of Diseases 11 (ICD-11) says that there are two types of vision problems: those that affect vision at a distance and those that affect vision up close. There are four distinct degrees of visual impairment. Mild visual acuity is between 6/12 and 6/18, moderate visual acuity is between 6/18 and 6/60, severe visual acuity is between 6/60 and 3/60, and blindness is below 3/60.\n2.2.\tOverview of Visual Assistive Technology\n\tThere are three approaches to this in visual assistive technologies: visual enhancement, visual substitution, and visual replacement (Elmannai & Elleithy, 2017). Visual substitution is like a replacement for a blind person's eyes. An image is taken with a camera, the information is processed, and feedback is given through sound, vibration, or a combination of the two. With visual enhancement, on the other hand, the information is given visually, like in virtual reality or augmented reality. In the last step, visual replacement analyses the information and displays it in the cortex of the user's brain; this technique is most frequently employed in the medical profession. In this project, we are investigating and constructing a visual substitution device. Thus, that will be the primary topic of this paper (Elmannai & Elleithy, 2017).The visual substitution has three subheadings: electronic travel aids (ETA), electronic orientation aids (EOA), and position locator devices (PLD).\nThe authors have given a few recommendation that we highly agree on which are (Kuriakose et al., 2020):\n1.\tThe use of effective and appropriate real-time object detection methods is crucial when developing ETAs, as real-time operations are essential to be considered in this scenario.\n2.\tThe availability of multiple feedback mechanisms is also one of the aspects of developing quality ETAs, as single-mode feedback might provide liability to the user, such as auditory feedback when in a crowded and loud area. Users should be able to toggle through multiple feedback modes depending on their taste and the scenario.\n3.\tThe user-friendly aspect of the device must take into deep consideration as many visual assistive technologies are burdensome to use and learn as it takes much time to get used to and learn.\n4.\tThe amount of information projected to the user must also be fine tune as the main point of navigating is to reach their destination safely. If the user is overwhelmed with too much information about what is happening around them, they will not have a good time navigating using the ETAs. During navigation, they may be required to be informed of changes in the surrounding environment, such as traffic jams, hazards, and dangerous environments. During navigation, the appropriate quantity of contextual information should be provided to the user at the appropriate time (Balakrishnan, 2017). For the navigation solution to be effective, it is recommended to emphasise the communication of relevant environmental data (Giudice & Legge, n.d.).\n5.\tMore often than not, technical advances cannot convince the visually handicapped to like them. Users of a navigational aid system must feel comfortable and not be embarrassed by using it (Abdolrahmani et al., 2017). The most effective solution is to create a device that is simple to use and does not make people feel awkward when they use it in public.\n6.\tPrivacy and security are critical when developing a device that will be used every day by visually impaired individuals. When making a navigation device for the blind and visually impaired, it is crucial to think about how to handle private and personal information . Users who are blind should be able to set up their navigation devices to decide what information is needed to run the process and what information is sent over the network. This parameter can be changed based on the user's wants and how the system is used.\n2.3.\tPrevious work of Visual Assistive Technology\n2.3.1.\tHead wear\n2.3.1.1.\tWearable Travel Aid for Environment Perception and Navigation of Visually Impaired People\n\tFor this project, a consumer Red, Green, Blue, and Depth (RGB-D) camera was attached to a pair of eyeglasses, along with an inertial measurement unit (IMU) attached to a camera, a smartphone, and an earphone for commands/feedback. The system is operable in both indoor and outdoor settings. Due to their ample information, lightweight nature, and low cost compared to other sensors, such as ultrasonic and LiDAR sensors, computer vision technologies were integrated into this device's routing and detection capabilities. The smartphone does the process of detecting and routing, and the feedback is sent to the user's ear through an earphone plugged into the smartphone (Bai et al., 2019).\nLimitation:\n\u2022\tWeak in detecting small-size obstacle\n\u2022\tStaircase detection is not implemented\u2003\n2.3.1.2.\tLet Blind People See: Real-Time Visual Recognition with Results Converted to 3D Audio\n\tJiang et al. (2016) created a system that took video input from a portable camera. They streamed it to a server for real-time image recognition processing using the You Only Live Once (YOLO) model. The 3D location of the discovered object is derived by using the location and size of the object detection algorithm's bounding boxes. The Unity game engine will send it as 3D audio into their attached wireless earphones. The next sound output interval will be in a few seconds or when a different object is detected, whichever occurs first. The solution could conduct precise real-time objective detection with a live stream at a pace of 30 frames per second in 1080p resolution by utilising the YOLO algorithm and an enhanced wireless transmitter. Figure 4 shows the data flow pipeline of the paper\u2019s system. The video footage is captured and sent to the YOLO algorithm for detecting object. The detected object is then send to the earbuds using the unity engine. Figure 5 shows the prototype of the device of this paper.\nLimitation:\n\u2022\tCan only accurately detect and classify object within 2 to 5 meters away\n\u2022\tSurrounding ambient will be block when using earbuds\n\u2022\tToo much information will be sent to user when camera detect multiple objects\n2.3.2.\tSmart Cane\n2.3.2.1.\tSmart Electronic Stick for Visually Impaired using Android Application and Google\u2019s Cloud Vision\n\tThe e-stick module, integrated with a voice-controlled Android application, was designed by Bharatia et al. (2019) to replace the essential simple navigation stick that visually impaired individuals typically use. The e-stick is similar to a standard stick in that it is thin, lightweight, and easy to handle, but it has additional features. Using efficient natural language processing (NLP) features makes these functionalities affordable and possible. The e-stick uses ultrasonic sensors to find low-lying and knee-level obstacles and potholes when moving backwards. Using buzzers, active input on the presence of barriers will be delivered. For Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation to function, the user's phone will be Bluetooth-connected to the stick's circuit. In unavoidable circumstances, the live location of visually impaired individuals will be transmitted to the nearest help centre or their family for assistance. Face detection will be added so that users can tell who is trying to talk to them. With the cloud vision API, it is also possible to translate traffic lights and roadside signs so that blind people can find their way. Text recognition will also be available from photos, making it easy for people to read books, documents, newspapers, and other printed materials. A stick-tracking device has also been built in case the person loses his or her stick. These capabilities will be enabled through hardware (smart stick) and a software module (an Android application). Using Natural Language Processing technology, the user will tell these modules what to do by using voice commands. The e-stick will be charged as needed using a rechargeable circuit. Figure 6 shows how the technologies used in this paper interact.\nLimitation:\n\u2022\tCoverage of obstacle detection is short as it is using sensor\n\u2022\tOnly suitable for indoor\n2.3.2.2.\tWeWalk\n\tWeWalk is a smart cane developed by a non-profit organisation called YGA (WeWALK Smart Cane \u2013 Smart Cane for the Visually Impaired, 2020). WeWalk looks like a traditional-looking cane, but the handle has a built-in touchpad. Users can navigate, save and discover places using the cane via the respected application. Particular layers are built into the mapping services for more accessible navigation. Users can choose to use the built-in speaker or Bluetooth for voice feedback. Users can also pair their phone with the intelligent cane via Bluetooth to control their phone. The above-ground The built-in ultrasound sensor detects an above-ground obstacle. The detected obstacle is projected back to the user in the form of vibration or audio, depending on the user\u2019s preferences. Wewalk also has an application where users can view their transit options, such as nearby bus stops and the timetable, and then navigate them to the desired stop. The application also has a built-in voice assistant for more straightforward navigation through the application. If a user loses their phone or cane, they can play a sound on each of them to locate the position of the lost device. Figure 7 shows the WeWalk Smart Cane that is currently on the market.\nLimitation:\n\u2022\tThe device is very expansive, with the price of 500 USD\n\u2022\tRain or snow might cause malfunction on the smart cane and the speaker\n\u2022\tThe tip of the cane is loud when navigating rough surface sidewalk\n2.3.2.3.\tDevelopment of an Intelligent Cane for Visually Impaired Human Subjects\n\tAsati et al., (2019) designed an intelligent white cane that uses HR-SO4 ultrasonic sensors to identify obstacles within a range of 450 meters and determine the distance. The object above head level will also be detected, as the sensors' range is 450 meters. The warning signal is returned in beeping signals via a buzzer, advising the user to take prompt action. Object detection and classification are done utilizing the intelligent technique. The photos are recorded using the web camera for classification. They will be transformed into text and an audio signal for text-to-speech conversion. Figure 8 shows the prototype of this paper's intelligent cane.\nLimitation:\n\u2022\tCost of building the system is high\n\u2022\tUnable to identify pot holes\n\u2022\tDetection under rainy weather is not tested\n\u2003\n2.3.3.\tHandheld\n2.3.3.1.\tAndroid Application for Object Recognition Using Neural Networks for the Visually Impaired\n\tDosi et al. (2018) have developed an Android application that aids the visually impaired with real-time object recognition using the phone's camera and provides feedback by speaking the recognised object. They opted for a deep learning strategy based on a convolutional neural network for improved recognition and faster response times. MobileNets is utilised because it is ideal for mobile and embedded vision applications. Figure 9 shows the results of the detected object using the object recognition application.\nLimitation:\n\u2022\tOnly works offline\n\u2022\tUnknown or untrained objects will be predicted using existing images in the database\n\u2022\tHave to retrain model for untrained object\n2.3.3.2.\tDesign and Implementation of an Embedded Real-Time System for Guiding Visually Impaired Individuals\n\tDuman et al. (2019) have developed and implemented a portable gadget that detects objects and measures their distance precisely to enable visually impaired individuals to see objects and people around them. The device uses YOLO, a convolutional neural network-based real-time identification method with a single device attached to a Raspberry Pi board. The estimated object distance will be projected in audio form to visually challenged users. The accuracy of this detected distance estimation is 98.8%. Initially, the footage is captured using a handheld Raspberry Pi camera. Afterwards, the object detection module executes YOLO for real-time object recognition, and bounding box size extraction for humans is needed. The size of the bounding box is provided to the distance estimation module to determine the distance of the detected individual. The labels of detected objects and the approximated distance of any individual caught are stored temporarily. An audio generation module translates text-based saved results into audio alerts that visually challenged users can listen to using headphones. Alerts are played at a predetermined time to reduce noise and ambiguity. Figure 10 shows the block diagram of the paper\u2019s proposed system.\nLimitation:\n\u2022\tOnly detect humans\n\u2022\tNo design for any wearable option\u2003\n2.3.3.3.\tReal-time object detection and face recognition system to assist the visually impaired\n\tAnish Aralikatti et al. (2020) developed an android application that used the phone camera for real-time object and face detection using OpenCV, the You only live once (YOLO) algorithm and FaceNet. Detection of objects and human will be presented in an audio format to the user. OpenCV is used for real-time computer vision tasks. Since it is implemented into an android phone, they chose Tiny YOLO as it is a lightweight YOLO framework perfect for embedded and mobile devices. FaceNet is used for face identification systems as it can extract high-quality features of the face. Figure 12 shows the sample outputs of using the android application on a mobile phone. Figure 11 shows the face recognition feature of the android application.\nLimitation: Less accuracy than YOLO as Tiny YOLO model is smaller (Anish Aralikatti et al., 2020)", "response": "\u2003\n2.4.\tTechnical Challenges\n\tThere are several technical difficulties that visually impaired people encounter while using various assistive technologies, including:\n1.\tAccuracy\n2.\tProcessing Speed\n3.\tInterference and Interferences\n4.\tReliability\n5.\tAvailability of accurate information\n6.\tLink speed\n7.\tPosition and pose estimation\n8.\tCommunication\n9.\tProblem of loss of signals\n10.\tHigh-speed switching\n11.\tComputer Vision\n12.\tInformation Overload\n13.\tPositioning\n14.\tWeb Services\n15.\tDevice Management\n16.\tChallenges related to camera and sensor placement\n17.\tOther difficulties\n2.5.\tTechnical Challenges-Visual Assistive Technology\n\tTechnical difficulties in the design of visual assistive technology include smart canes and smart glasses.

ABSTRACT\nTuberculosis (TB) imposes a major burden on global public health which is exacerbated by the escalating number of multidrug-resistant (MDR)-TB cases. There is consequently an urgent need for new anti-TB drugs and combination regimens. We have investigated the natural product antibiotic fusidic acid (FA) for repurposing against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of TB. Here, we report the results of synergy screens combining FA with a panel of approved anti-TB agents. Checkerboard and time-kill kinetics assays identified seven compounds from different chemical classes that synergized with FA in inhibiting the growth of M. tuberculosis in vitro: rifampicin (RIF), a rifamycin and frontline anti-TB drug; the macrolides, erythromycin (ERY), clarithromycin (CLR), and roxythromycin (ROX); the oxazolidinone, linezolid (LZD); the aminoglycoside, streptomycin (STR); and the aminocyclitol, spectinomycin (SPC). Among these, the strongest synergies were observed where FA was combined with SPC and ERY. Moreover, the FA-RIF combination was cidal, while all other FA combinations were bacteriostatic. These results provide in vitro evidence of the potential utility of FA-containing combinations against M. tuberculosis.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nCombination therapy is essential to the clinical management of tuberculosis (TB) disease (1). Until recently, strategies to identify and advance promising combinations during early-stage pre-clinical TB drug discovery were limited. However, growing recognition of the need to identify new anti-TB drugs and regimens has re-focused attention on early-stage pre-clinical identification of synergizing combination partners for potential development (2), including drugs which are not clinically effective against TB (3, 4).\n\nAs part of a drug repurposing strategy, we utilized fusidic acid (FA) as anchor compound in developing matrix screening assays aimed at identifying optimal drug combination(s) that might be evaluated within the existing TB drug pipeline for potential clinical efficacy. FA, a translational inhibitor with demonstrated (albeit moderate) activity in vitro (5, 6), was selected owing to its unique mechanism of action: specifically, inhibition of mycobacterial protein synthesis by binding to elongation factor G (EF-G) (7). The antimicrobial-potentiating effect of FA with other antibiotics including the frontline anti-TB drug, ethambutol (EMB), as well as its lack of cross-resistance to other antimicrobial classes, provided additional motivation for our choice of FA (8, 9). In this short report, we present the analysis of in vitro interactions between FA and partner compounds comprising drugs currently used in TB treatment and selected translational inhibitors, the latter selected to enable evaluation the effects of combining FA with drugs acting on the same pathway (Fig. 1), (10, 11).\n\nFigure 1.\nDownload figureOpen in new tab\nFigure 1.\nAntibiotic targets in protein synthesis:\nSchematic representation indicating known and predicted target sites of antibiotics disrupting different stages in the (myco)bacterial translation pathway. The tRNA binding sites - amino acid (A), peptide (P), and exit (E) - on the ribosome are indicated. Adopted and modified from Wilson et al. (10).\n\nRESULTS\nCheckerboard assay identifies synergistic drug combination partners for fusidic acid\nTo identify potential partners of FA, our preliminary screens utilized Mycobacterium smegmatis mc2155, a fast-growing, non-pathogenic mycobacterium which has been exploited as a useful surrogate in drug efficacy studies in vitro. In standard two-drug checkerboard experiments (Table S1), SPC, ERY, CLR and TET exhibited synergy with FA, defined as FICI \u2264 0.5. These combinations displayed a 4-to 16-fold reduction in MIC90 for each of the individual drugs (Fig. S1). No antagonistic effects were observed with any of the combinations tested.\n\nThe synergies detected in M. smegmatis informed subsequent selection of combination partners for evaluation in M. tuberculosis using the checkerboard method. In addition, representative drugs consisting of clinically used anti-TB agents (first- and second-line) and selected translational inhibitors were tested in combination with FA. For these assays, a M. tuberculosis H37Rv reporter strain expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) was used, as described previously (12). Fig. S2 provides an example of an interaction study in which FA and ERY were analysed in the checkerboard assay. Results in Table 1 show similarity to those obtained for M. smegmatis, such that SPC, ERY and CLR exhibited synergy with FA against M. tuberculosis. The combination of FA and ERY returned a FICI value of 0.25, indicating a synergistic interaction (Fig. S2A). Other drugs that synergized with FA included RIF, STR, roxithromycin (ROX), and LZD. These synergistic interactions generally resulted in 4-to 8-fold reductions in the MICs of each drug within the combination. Even though the combination of FA and BDQ did not result in a FICI value of \u2264 0.5, it is important to note that the two displayed approximately a 4-fold reduction in their respective MICs, and the observed FICI (0.55) was very close to that defined as \u201csynergy\u201d. No antagonistic interaction was observed between FA and any of the compounds tested. For the combinations exhibiting synergy with FA, isobolograms were constructed by plotting the FIC curves of the FA-drug combinations (Fig. S3). Interactions between FA and ERY, SPC, and RIF were well within the synergy region (FICI < 0.5) whereas FA with STR, LZD, and ROX indicated borderline synergy (FICI = 0.5). The FA-INH interaction was included as a \u201cno interaction\u201d control.\n\nView inlineView popup\nTable 1.\nIn vitro synergistic interaction between FA and anti TB agents or selected translational inhibitors against M. tuberculosis::gfp\n\nTo confirm results obtained using the checkerboard assay, the strongly synergistic FA-ERY combination was evaluated in a growth inhibition assay (Fig. S4). For this purpose, FA and ERY were used at 0.3 and 27 \u00b5M, respectively, since these were the concentrations at which the lowest FICI value was obtained in the checkerboard assay (Fig. S2). RIF, at a concentration of 0.015 \u00b5M, was included as a control. In the absence of drug, the population of M. tuberculosis increased over 14 days post-inoculation. In contrast, the population of viable cells remained relatively constant over the same duration when the growth medium contained the FA and ERY combination. Similarly, the medium containing FA, ERY plus sub-MIC RIF did not display any increase in the number of viable bacterial population over a 14-day period. In contrast, cultures incubated in the presence of the individual antibiotics, FA or ERY, showed equivalent growth to the untreated control.\n\nAssessing synergistic and peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of FA synergizing drugs for optimal therapy\nAs a key consideration for the clinical potential of FA combinations, the respective concentrations at which synergy was observed were compared with the reported peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) for each drug. This is important in understanding whether the concentrations required to achieve the desired response are therapeutically feasible \u2013 and, consequently, whether the results obtained from an in vitro assay have any utility in guiding therapeutic use. Except for the FA-ERY interaction, synergies between FA and its partners were achieved at concentrations predicted to be below the maximum plasma concentrations (13, 14), suggesting that these concentrations are therapeutically achievable (Fig. S5). For example, the presence of FA decreased the MIC of SPC from 201 \u00b5M to 3.14 \u00b5M, which represents a greater than 98% reduction in the MIC (Table S2). This reduced concentration is far below the Cmax value of SPC in humans (30.8 \u00b5M), determined following a 1000 mg intramuscular dose (15).\n\nAssessing cidal versus static synergies\nTo determine whether FA interactions resulted in killing or merely inhibited the growth of M. tuberculosis, the method of Zhang et al. was utilized (16). INH, a bactericidal agent, was used as a reference drug, and all drugs were tested alone and in combination against the M. tuberculosis H37Rv::gfp bioreporter strain. Results for the bacteriostatic or cidal effects of the drug combinations with FA are illustrated (Figure 2). The FA-RIF combination displayed a MBC/MIC ratio of \u2264 2 on day 14 of evaluation, suggesting cidality. The other combinations tested \u2013 combining FA with SPC, ERY, CLR, ROX or LZD \u2013 all exhibited MBC/MIC ratios >2, implying static effects. The bacteriostatic/cidal action of individual drugs is shown in Fig. S6.\n\nFigure 2.\nDownload figureOpen in new tab\nFigure 2.\nBactericidal versus static effects of drug combinations against M. tuberculosis.\nAnalysis of FA in combination with synergizing drugs; ERY, SPC, CLR, ROX, RIF, and LZD. INH was used as reference drug. MBC/MIC ratio \u22642: cidal; MBC/MIC ratio > 2: static. *Sub-inhibitory concentrations of FA that exhibited the respective synergies in these checkerboard experiments are between (0.3 \u2013 1.2 \u00b5M) Data are from a representative experiment performed in triplicate. Error bars indicate standard deviations, calculated from the mean of triplicate samples.\n\nFA synergizing partners are active against the FA-resistant mutant\nA cross-resistance study was performed using a FA-resistant M. tuberculosis mutant carrying H462Y mutation in fusA1(11). The FA-resistant mutant exhibited >100-fold MIC compared to the FA-susceptible parental strain. Six synergistic FA partner drugs \u2013 RIF, SPC, CLR, ERY, STR and ROX \u2013 were evaluated using the resazurin reduction microplate assay (REMA). The results (Fig. S7) indicated that the MIC90 values of these drugs remained the same against the FA-resistant mutant relative to the wild-type strain, confirming that there was no cross-resistance to each of the tested compounds.\n\nInteraction of FA synergizing partners with selected chemically unrelated compounds\nUsing a set of six chemically and structurally diverse drug agents (Table S3), a combination assay was performed with four drugs that had displayed synergistic interaction with FA: RIF, ERY, CLR and SPC. The aim was to determine whether these compounds displayed synergy only with FA or exhibited a wider spectrum of synergistic interactions. The results of these pairwise combinations (Figure 3) revealed potentiating interactions between all FA synergizing partners (except RIF) and THS, BDQ and CPZ. CLR displayed strong synergies with BDQ and CPZ (FICI = 0.23 in both cases). The interaction between SPC and INH was also synergistic, while the remaining compounds (EMB and MOX) exhibited no interactions in combination with RIF, ERY, CLR and SPC.\n\nFigure 3.\nDownload figureOpen in new tab\nFigure 3.\nDrug interaction study.\nPairwise interactions between selected drugs (blue fonts) and synergizing agents (black fonts) of FA (using M. tuberculosis H37Rv::gfp. Red panels indicate synergistic interactions (FICI \u2264 0.5), while green panels are no interaction (0.5 < FICI \u2264 4). The bars indicate the fold-reduction in MIC required to achieve the same effect in combination versus single-drug assays. For example, in the interaction between RIF and MOX, top right-hand panel, the FIC for RIF = 0.45 (black bar) and MOX = 0.9 (blue bar). The resulting FICI for RIF-MOX = 1.35 (green bar) which indicates an additive interaction. Data are from the representative experiment performed in duplicate.\n\n", "response": "DISCUSSION\nRepurposing of clinically established antibiotics into the drug development pipeline for TB aims at optimizing current interventions. Our study supports this approach by demonstrating synergistic effects between the recently introduced antibiotic, FA, and selected anti-TB drugs. Our findings demonstrate the potential utility of these combinations against M. tuberculosis. Synergistic interactions were observed for seven different anti-TB drugs: RIF, ERY, CLR, SPC, ROX, STR, and LZD. Among these, the strongest synergies were observed with SPC and ERY.\n\nThe checkerboard assay and time-kill kinetics were used to evaluate the impacts of FA on the activity of each drug.

Is there anything else you would like to know about this code?can execute. no error. but, the df1, df2 column label not exiting in the output excel.It looks like the column labels in df1 and df2 are being set by assigning values to the df1.columns and df2.columns attributes, respectively. However, these attributes are not being set in the final output Excel file.One possible reason for this is that the column labels are being set after the data in df1 and df2 has been written to the output Excel file. You could try moving the lines that set the column labels to before the lines that write the data to the file.For example, you could try replacing these lines:Copy codedf1.to_excel(output_filename, index=False)\ndf2.to_excel(output_filename, index=False, header=None, startrow=len(df1) + 1)\nwith these lines:Copy codedf1.columns = ['Model', 'Rank', 'Category', 'Country', 'Rank.1', 'Rank.2', 'Rank.3', 'Rank.4', 'Rank.5']\ndf2.columns = ['model_column', 'model', 'count', 'unique_column', 'fifth_column']\n\ndf1.to_excel(output_filename, index=False)\ndf2.to_excel(output_filename, index=False, header=None, startrow=len(df1) + 1)\nThis should set the column labels in the output Excel file to the values specified in the df1.columns and df2.columns attributes.I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.I mean I want the column label of df1 and df2 be output to the output excel also.To include the column labels in the output Excel file, you can use the write_row() method of the Worksheet object to write the column labels to the first row of the sheet.Here's an example of how you can modify your code to do this:Copy code# Write the column labels to the first row of the output Excel file\nworksheet.write_row(0, 0, df1.columns)\n\n# Write the data from df1 to the output Excel file\nfor r, row in enumerate(df1.values):\n    worksheet.write_row(r + 1, 0, row)\n\n# Write the column labels to the first row of the second sheet of the output Excel file\nworksheet2.write_row(0, 0, df2.columns)\n\n# Write the data from df2 to the second sheet of the output Excel file\nfor r, row in enumerate(df2.values):\n    worksheet2.write_row(r + 1, 0, row)\n\n# Save the changes to the output Excel file\nworkbook.close()\nThis code will write the column labels from df1 and df2 to the first row of the corresponding sheets in the output Excel file, and then write the data from df1 and df2 to the subsequent rows of the sheets.I hope this helps!

However, this essay argues that social media can still have advantages particularly in the realm of education (or learning). The author doesn't argue that we should go back to online learning modality but rather argue that it can be a helpful tool for learning.\n\nThe essay argues that social media can be an effective tool for students to gather information for research and to access additional information about their studies. It acknowledges that social media can be a convenient and efficient source of information. Despite that, the essay also recognizes that social media can also feed too much information to users, and some of it may be inappropriate for students. Finally, it emphasizes that learners must have discipline to use social media as a learning tool.\n\nThis essay provides a good overview of the advantages and disadvantages of using social media as a tool for learning. However, to make it more effective, there are some areas that need improvement. Firstly, the thesis statement needs to be more specific and detailed. While it mentions that social media can be used for learning, it fails to provide any additional information about the argument or the points that will be made in the essay. Therefore, a clear and concise thesis statement must be added to the end of the introductory paragraph to give readers a better idea of what to expect from the essay. Secondly, the essay lacks a clear and organized structure. It jumps between different ideas and points without always relating them to the main argument. A more focused approach with each paragraph clearly linked to the thesis statement would improve the essay's coherence and make it easier to follow. Thirdly, the writer makes some good points about social media's advantages and disadvantages in learning, but these arguments need to be supported with data and specific examples. This would strengthen the arguments and make the essay more persuasive. Lastly, the conclusion should be more impactful by summarizing the main points, restating the thesis statement, and providing actionable recommendations for using social media as a tool for learning. By making these improvements, the essay would be more persuasive and effective in presenting the pros and cons of using social media for learning.\n\nTo conclude, this essay provides insightful perspectives on the advantages and disadvantages of using social media for learning. To enhance the clarity and impact of its arguments, the essay would benefit from a clearer and more concise thesis statement, a more organized structure, and the inclusion of supporting evidence and data. Furthermore, a stronger conclusion that summarizes the key points and provides actionable recommendations would strengthen the overall effectiveness of the essay.

The system is operable in both indoor and outdoor settings. Due to their ample information, lightweight nature, and low cost compared to other sensors, such as ultrasonic and LiDAR sensors, computer vision technologies were integrated into this device's routing and detection capabilities. The smartphone does the process of detecting and routing, and the feedback is sent to the user's ear through an earphone plugged into the smartphone (Bai et al., 2019).\nLimitation:\n\u2022\tWeak in detecting small-size obstacle\n\u2022\tStaircase detection is not implemented\u2003\n2.3.1.2.\tLet Blind People See: Real-Time Visual Recognition with Results Converted to 3D Audio\n\tJiang et al. (2016) created a system that took video input from a portable camera. They streamed it to a server for real-time image recognition processing using the You Only Live Once (YOLO) model. The 3D location of the discovered object is derived by using the location and size of the object detection algorithm's bounding boxes. The Unity game engine will send it as 3D audio into their attached wireless earphones. The next sound output interval will be in a few seconds or when a different object is detected, whichever occurs first. The solution could conduct precise real-time objective detection with a live stream at a pace of 30 frames per second in 1080p resolution by utilising the YOLO algorithm and an enhanced wireless transmitter. Figure 4 shows the data flow pipeline of the paper\u2019s system. The video footage is captured and sent to the YOLO algorithm for detecting object. The detected object is then send to the earbuds using the unity engine. Figure 5 shows the prototype of the device of this paper.\nLimitation:\n\u2022\tCan only accurately detect and classify object within 2 to 5 meters away\n\u2022\tSurrounding ambient will be block when using earbuds\n\u2022\tToo much information will be sent to user when camera detect multiple objects\n2.3.2.\tSmart Cane\n2.3.2.1.\tSmart Electronic Stick for Visually Impaired using Android Application and Google\u2019s Cloud Vision\n\tThe e-stick module, integrated with a voice-controlled Android application, was designed by Bharatia et al. (2019) to replace the essential simple navigation stick that visually impaired individuals typically use. The e-stick is similar to a standard stick in that it is thin, lightweight, and easy to handle, but it has additional features. Using efficient natural language processing (NLP) features makes these functionalities affordable and possible. The e-stick uses ultrasonic sensors to find low-lying and knee-level obstacles and potholes when moving backwards. Using buzzers, active input on the presence of barriers will be delivered. For Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation to function, the user's phone will be Bluetooth-connected to the stick's circuit. In unavoidable circumstances, the live location of visually impaired individuals will be transmitted to the nearest help centre or their family for assistance. Face detection will be added so that users can tell who is trying to talk to them. With the cloud vision API, it is also possible to translate traffic lights and roadside signs so that blind people can find their way. Text recognition will also be available from photos, making it easy for people to read books, documents, newspapers, and other printed materials. A stick-tracking device has also been built in case the person loses his or her stick. These capabilities will be enabled through hardware (smart stick) and a software module (an Android application). Using Natural Language Processing technology, the user will tell these modules what to do by using voice commands. The e-stick will be charged as needed using a rechargeable circuit. Figure 6 shows how the technologies used in this paper interact.\nLimitation:\n\u2022\tCoverage of obstacle detection is short as it is using sensor\n\u2022\tOnly suitable for indoor\n2.3.2.2.\tWeWalk\n\tWeWalk is a smart cane developed by a non-profit organisation called YGA (WeWALK Smart Cane \u2013 Smart Cane for the Visually Impaired, 2020). WeWalk looks like a traditional-looking cane, but the handle has a built-in touchpad. Users can navigate, save and discover places using the cane via the respected application. Particular layers are built into the mapping services for more accessible navigation. Users can choose to use the built-in speaker or Bluetooth for voice feedback. Users can also pair their phone with the intelligent cane via Bluetooth to control their phone. The above-ground The built-in ultrasound sensor detects an above-ground obstacle. The detected obstacle is projected back to the user in the form of vibration or audio, depending on the user\u2019s preferences. Wewalk also has an application where users can view their transit options, such as nearby bus stops and the timetable, and then navigate them to the desired stop. The application also has a built-in voice assistant for more straightforward navigation through the application. If a user loses their phone or cane, they can play a sound on each of them to locate the position of the lost device. Figure 7 shows the WeWalk Smart Cane that is currently on the market.\nLimitation:\n\u2022\tThe device is very expansive, with the price of 500 USD\n\u2022\tRain or snow might cause malfunction on the smart cane and the speaker\n\u2022\tThe tip of the cane is loud when navigating rough surface sidewalk\n2.3.2.3.\tDevelopment of an Intelligent Cane for Visually Impaired Human Subjects\n\tAsati et al., (2019) designed an intelligent white cane that uses HR-SO4 ultrasonic sensors to identify obstacles within a range of 450 meters and determine the distance. The object above head level will also be detected, as the sensors' range is 450 meters. The warning signal is returned in beeping signals via a buzzer, advising the user to take prompt action. Object detection and classification are done utilizing the intelligent technique. The photos are recorded using the web camera for classification. They will be transformed into text and an audio signal for text-to-speech conversion. Figure 8 shows the prototype of this paper's intelligent cane.\nLimitation:\n\u2022\tCost of building the system is high\n\u2022\tUnable to identify pot holes\n\u2022\tDetection under rainy weather is not tested\n\u2003\n2.3.3.\tHandheld\n2.3.3.1.\tAndroid Application for Object Recognition Using Neural Networks for the Visually Impaired\n\tDosi et al. (2018) have developed an Android application that aids the visually impaired with real-time object recognition using the phone's camera and provides feedback by speaking the recognised object. They opted for a deep learning strategy based on a convolutional neural network for improved recognition and faster response times. MobileNets is utilised because it is ideal for mobile and embedded vision applications. Figure 9 shows the results of the detected object using the object recognition application.\nLimitation:\n\u2022\tOnly works offline\n\u2022\tUnknown or untrained objects will be predicted using existing images in the database\n\u2022\tHave to retrain model for untrained object\n2.3.3.2.\tDesign and Implementation of an Embedded Real-Time System for Guiding Visually Impaired Individuals\n\tDuman et al. (2019) have developed and implemented a portable gadget that detects objects and measures their distance precisely to enable visually impaired individuals to see objects and people around them. The device uses YOLO, a convolutional neural network-based real-time identification method with a single device attached to a Raspberry Pi board. The estimated object distance will be projected in audio form to visually challenged users. The accuracy of this detected distance estimation is 98.8%. Initially, the footage is captured using a handheld Raspberry Pi camera. Afterwards, the object detection module executes YOLO for real-time object recognition, and bounding box size extraction for humans is needed. The size of the bounding box is provided to the distance estimation module to determine the distance of the detected individual. The labels of detected objects and the approximated distance of any individual caught are stored temporarily. An audio generation module translates text-based saved results into audio alerts that visually challenged users can listen to using headphones. Alerts are played at a predetermined time to reduce noise and ambiguity. Figure 10 shows the block diagram of the paper\u2019s proposed system.\nLimitation:\n\u2022\tOnly detect humans\n\u2022\tNo design for any wearable option\u2003\n2.3.3.3.\tReal-time object detection and face recognition system to assist the visually impaired\n\tAnish Aralikatti et al. (2020) developed an android application that used the phone camera for real-time object and face detection using OpenCV, the You only live once (YOLO) algorithm and FaceNet. Detection of objects and human will be presented in an audio format to the user. OpenCV is used for real-time computer vision tasks. Since it is implemented into an android phone, they chose Tiny YOLO as it is a lightweight YOLO framework perfect for embedded and mobile devices. FaceNet is used for face identification systems as it can extract high-quality features of the face. Figure 12 shows the sample outputs of using the android application on a mobile phone. Figure 11 shows the face recognition feature of the android application.\nLimitation: Less accuracy than YOLO as Tiny YOLO model is smaller (Anish Aralikatti et al., 2020)", "response": "\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\n2.3.4.\tOther\n2.3.4.1.\tReal-time Object Recognition of Visually Impaired Person using Computer Vision\n\tTandon and Bhattacharya (2019) build a real-time object recognition system for visually impaired individuals using a smartphone camera.

After receiving the server results, the system sends a warning to the user through an earbud. The system can detect objects within 2 meters away and can be used in both indoor and outdoor environments. The system also employs environmental and user information for improving the system\u2019s performance. The system uses the device information, such as the user\u2019s location, speed, and the device\u2019s battery level.

Soil type plays a crucial role, as soils with high organic matter content tend to store more carbon. Climate also has a significant impact, with warmer and wetter climates generally leading to higher carbon storage. Management practices, such as grazing and mowing, can also affect carbon storage by influencing soil health and the growth of vegetation.\nTo understand the carbon storage potential of grasslands, researchers have developed several metrics, including the Global Grassland Carbon Storage Map.

So when stacked together, the thickness will be 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2 inch. But the question asks for the thickness in one-hundredths of an inch. One-hundredth is 1/100. Since 1 inch is equal to 100 one-hundredths, 1/2 inch is equal to 50 one-hundredths. So, the answer is 50. This question is not too hard, because the conversion from 1/2 inch to one-hundredths is straightforward and is a basic math fact", "tokens": 199, "duration": 32.60626530647278}

The primary difference between the two lies in the target variable. In prediction, the goal is to forecast a continuous value. In classification, the aim is to categorize instances into predefined classes. For instance, predicting house prices or stock prices are typical prediction tasks, whereas identifying whether a customer will purchase a product based on their profile or recognizing handwritten digits are classic classification tasks.\n2. Classification\nClassification is a type of supervised learning where the algorithm is trained on labeled data to predict the class or category of new, unseen data. In classification, the goal is to assign a new instance of data into one of the predefined categories or classes. For instance, in a spam detection model, the goal is to classify emails as either \"spam\" or \"not spam.\"\n3.

The paper \"Circumscribed Polygons with Minimal Perimeter\" is published in the journal \"Indian Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics\" in 2013. The paper is a mathematical research paper that deals with the problem of finding the circumscribed polygon with the minimal perimeter.\nFrom the paper, we can infer that the authors have made several contributions to the field of mathematics, particularly in the area of geometric optimization. They have introduced a new method for finding the circumscribed polygon with the minimal perimeter, which is based on the geometric properties of polygons and the concept of convex combinations.\nThe authors have also provided a detailed analysis of the problem, including the derivation of the necessary conditions for the optimal solution. They have used various mathematical techniques, such as calculus and linear programming", "tokens": 200, "duration": 32.44174766540527}

The system is operable in both indoor and outdoor settings. Due to their ample information, lightweight nature, and low cost compared to other sensors, such as ultrasonic and LiDAR sensors, computer vision technologies were integrated into this device's routing and detection capabilities. The smartphone does the process of detecting and routing, and the feedback is sent to the user's ear through an earphone plugged into the smartphone (Bai et al., 2019).\nLimitation:\n\u2022\tWeak in detecting small-size obstacle\n\u2022\tStaircase detection is not implemented\u2003\n2.3.1.2.\tLet Blind People See: Real-Time Visual Recognition with Results Converted to 3D Audio\n\tJiang et al. (2016) created a system that took video input from a portable camera. They streamed it to a server for real-time image recognition processing using the You Only Live Once (YOLO) model. The 3D location of the discovered object is derived by using the location and size of the object detection algorithm's bounding boxes. The Unity game engine will send it as 3D audio into their attached wireless earphones. The next sound output interval will be in a few seconds or when a different object is detected, whichever occurs first. The solution could conduct precise real-time objective detection with a live stream at a pace of 30 frames per second in 1080p resolution by utilising the YOLO algorithm and an enhanced wireless transmitter. Figure 4 shows the data flow pipeline of the paper\u2019s system. The video footage is captured and sent to the YOLO algorithm for detecting object. The detected object is then send to the earbuds using the unity engine. Figure 5 shows the prototype of the device of this paper.\nLimitation:\n\u2022\tCan only accurately detect and classify object within 2 to 5 meters away\n\u2022\tSurrounding ambient will be block when using earbuds\n\u2022\tToo much information will be sent to user when camera detect multiple objects\n2.3.2.\tSmart Cane\n2.3.2.1.\tSmart Electronic Stick for Visually Impaired using Android Application and Google\u2019s Cloud Vision\n\tThe e-stick module, integrated with a voice-controlled Android application, was designed by Bharatia et al. (2019) to replace the essential simple navigation stick that visually impaired individuals typically use. The e-stick is similar to a standard stick in that it is thin, lightweight, and easy to handle, but it has additional features. Using efficient natural language processing (NLP) features makes these functionalities affordable and possible. The e-stick uses ultrasonic sensors to find low-lying and knee-level obstacles and potholes when moving backwards. Using buzzers, active input on the presence of barriers will be delivered. For Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation to function, the user's phone will be Bluetooth-connected to the stick's circuit. In unavoidable circumstances, the live location of visually impaired individuals will be transmitted to the nearest help centre or their family for assistance. Face detection will be added so that users can tell who is trying to talk to them. With the cloud vision API, it is also possible to translate traffic lights and roadside signs so that blind people can find their way. Text recognition will also be available from photos, making it easy for people to read books, documents, newspapers, and other printed materials. A stick-tracking device has also been built in case the person loses his or her stick. These capabilities will be enabled through hardware (smart stick) and a software module (an Android application). Using Natural Language Processing technology, the user will tell these modules what to do by using voice commands. The e-stick will be charged as needed using a rechargeable circuit. Figure 6 shows how the technologies used in this paper interact.\nLimitation:\n\u2022\tCoverage of obstacle detection is short as it is using sensor\n\u2022\tOnly suitable for indoor\n2.3.2.2.\tWeWalk\n\tWeWalk is a smart cane developed by a non-profit organisation called YGA (WeWALK Smart Cane \u2013 Smart Cane for the Visually Impaired, 2020). WeWalk looks like a traditional-looking cane, but the handle has a built-in touchpad. Users can navigate, save and discover places using the cane via the respected application. Particular layers are built into the mapping services for more accessible navigation. Users can choose to use the built-in speaker or Bluetooth for voice feedback. Users can also pair their phone with the intelligent cane via Bluetooth to control their phone. The above-ground The built-in ultrasound sensor detects an above-ground obstacle. The detected obstacle is projected back to the user in the form of vibration or audio, depending on the user\u2019s preferences. Wewalk also has an application where users can view their transit options, such as nearby bus stops and the timetable, and then navigate them to the desired stop. The application also has a built-in voice assistant for more straightforward navigation through the application. If a user loses their phone or cane, they can play a sound on each of them to locate the position of the lost device. Figure 7 shows the WeWalk Smart Cane that is currently on the market.\nLimitation:\n\u2022\tThe device is very expansive, with the price of 500 USD\n\u2022\tRain or snow might cause malfunction on the smart cane and the speaker\n\u2022\tThe tip of the cane is loud when navigating rough surface sidewalk\n2.3.2.3.\tDevelopment of an Intelligent Cane for Visually Impaired Human Subjects\n\tAsati et al., (2019) designed an intelligent white cane that uses HR-SO4 ultrasonic sensors to identify obstacles within a range of 450 meters and determine the distance. The object above head level will also be detected, as the sensors' range is 450 meters. The warning signal is returned in beeping signals via a buzzer, advising the user to take prompt action. Object detection and classification are done utilizing the intelligent technique. The photos are recorded using the web camera for classification. They will be transformed into text and an audio signal for text-to-speech conversion. Figure 8 shows the prototype of this paper's intelligent cane.\nLimitation:\n\u2022\tCost of building the system is high\n\u2022\tUnable to identify pot holes\n\u2022\tDetection under rainy weather is not tested\n\u2003\n2.3.3.\tHandheld\n2.3.3.1.\tAndroid Application for Object Recognition Using Neural Networks for the Visually Impaired\n\tDosi et al. (2018) have developed an Android application that aids the visually impaired with real-time object recognition using the phone's camera and provides feedback by speaking the recognised object. They opted for a deep learning strategy based on a convolutional neural network for improved recognition and faster response times. MobileNets is utilised because it is ideal for mobile and embedded vision applications. Figure 9 shows the results of the detected object using the object recognition application.\nLimitation:\n\u2022\tOnly works offline\n\u2022\tUnknown or untrained objects will be predicted using existing images in the database\n\u2022\tHave to retrain model for untrained object\n2.3.3.2.\tDesign and Implementation of an Embedded Real-Time System for Guiding Visually Impaired Individuals\n\tDuman et al. (2019) have developed and implemented a portable gadget that detects objects and measures their distance precisely to enable visually impaired individuals to see objects and people around them. The device uses YOLO, a convolutional neural network-based real-time identification method with a single device attached to a Raspberry Pi board. The estimated object distance will be projected in audio form to visually challenged users. The accuracy of this detected distance estimation is 98.8%. Initially, the footage is captured using a handheld Raspberry Pi camera. Afterwards, the object detection module executes YOLO for real-time object recognition, and bounding box size extraction for humans is needed. The size of the bounding box is provided to the distance estimation module to determine the distance of the detected individual. The labels of detected objects and the approximated distance of any individual caught are stored temporarily. An audio generation module translates text-based saved results into audio alerts that visually challenged users can listen to using headphones. Alerts are played at a predetermined time to reduce noise and ambiguity. Figure 10 shows the block diagram of the paper\u2019s proposed system.\nLimitation:\n\u2022\tOnly detect humans\n\u2022\tNo design for any wearable option\u2003\n2.3.3.3.\tReal-time object detection and face recognition system to assist the visually impaired\n\tAnish Aralikatti et al. (2020) developed an android application that used the phone camera for real-time object and face detection using OpenCV, the You only live once (YOLO) algorithm and FaceNet. Detection of objects and human will be presented in an audio format to the user. OpenCV is used for real-time computer vision tasks. Since it is implemented into an android phone, they chose Tiny YOLO as it is a lightweight YOLO framework perfect for embedded and mobile devices. FaceNet is used for face identification systems as it can extract high-quality features of the face. Figure 12 shows the sample outputs of using the android application on a mobile phone. Figure 11 shows the face recognition feature of the android application.\nLimitation: Less accuracy than YOLO as Tiny YOLO model is smaller (Anish Aralikatti et al., 2020)", "response": "  \n\u2003\n2.3.4.\tOther Assistive Technologies\n2.3.4.1.\tAssistive Technology for the Visually Impaired Using Deep Learning Technique\n\tChaudhary et al. (2020) developed an Android application that uses deep learning to detect the location of the Visually Impaired (VI) individual using Google Cloud\u2019s Mobile Vision API. The application uses a camera to capture the image. The location of the individual will be detected, and the information will be sent to the registered caregiver for assistance. The VI individual can also send a text message to the caregiver using the application.

The system is operable in both indoor and outdoor settings. Due to their ample information, lightweight nature, and low cost compared to other sensors, such as ultrasonic and LiDAR sensors, computer vision technologies were integrated into this device's routing and detection capabilities. The smartphone does the process of detecting and routing, and the feedback is sent to the user's ear through an earphone plugged into the smartphone (Bai et al., 2019).\nLimitation:\n\u2022\tWeak in detecting small-size obstacle\n\u2022\tStaircase detection is not implemented\u2003\n2.3.1.2.\tLet Blind People See: Real-Time Visual Recognition with Results Converted to 3D Audio\n\tJiang et al. (2016) created a system that took video input from a portable camera. They streamed it to a server for real-time image recognition processing using the You Only Live Once (YOLO) model. The 3D location of the discovered object is derived by using the location and size of the object detection algorithm's bounding boxes. The Unity game engine will send it as 3D audio into their attached wireless earphones. The next sound output interval will be in a few seconds or when a different object is detected, whichever occurs first. The solution could conduct precise real-time objective detection with a live stream at a pace of 30 frames per second in 1080p resolution by utilising the YOLO algorithm and an enhanced wireless transmitter. Figure 4 shows the data flow pipeline of the paper\u2019s system. The video footage is captured and sent to the YOLO algorithm for detecting object. The detected object is then send to the earbuds using the unity engine. Figure 5 shows the prototype of the device of this paper.\nLimitation:\n\u2022\tCan only accurately detect and classify object within 2 to 5 meters away\n\u2022\tSurrounding ambient will be block when using earbuds\n\u2022\tToo much information will be sent to user when camera detect multiple objects\n2.3.2.\tSmart Cane\n2.3.2.1.\tSmart Electronic Stick for Visually Impaired using Android Application and Google\u2019s Cloud Vision\n\tThe e-stick module, integrated with a voice-controlled Android application, was designed by Bharatia et al. (2019) to replace the essential simple navigation stick that visually impaired individuals typically use. The e-stick is similar to a standard stick in that it is thin, lightweight, and easy to handle, but it has additional features. Using efficient natural language processing (NLP) features makes these functionalities affordable and possible. The e-stick uses ultrasonic sensors to find low-lying and knee-level obstacles and potholes when moving backwards. Using buzzers, active input on the presence of barriers will be delivered. For Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation to function, the user's phone will be Bluetooth-connected to the stick's circuit. In unavoidable circumstances, the live location of visually impaired individuals will be transmitted to the nearest help centre or their family for assistance. Face detection will be added so that users can tell who is trying to talk to them. With the cloud vision API, it is also possible to translate traffic lights and roadside signs so that blind people can find their way. Text recognition will also be available from photos, making it easy for people to read books, documents, newspapers, and other printed materials. A stick-tracking device has also been built in case the person loses his or her stick. These capabilities will be enabled through hardware (smart stick) and a software module (an Android application). Using Natural Language Processing technology, the user will tell these modules what to do by using voice commands. The e-stick will be charged as needed using a rechargeable circuit. Figure 6 shows how the technologies used in this paper interact.\nLimitation:\n\u2022\tCoverage of obstacle detection is short as it is using sensor\n\u2022\tOnly suitable for indoor\n2.3.2.2.\tWeWalk\n\tWeWalk is a smart cane developed by a non-profit organisation called YGA (WeWALK Smart Cane \u2013 Smart Cane for the Visually Impaired, 2020). WeWalk looks like a traditional-looking cane, but the handle has a built-in touchpad. Users can navigate, save and discover places using the cane via the respected application. Particular layers are built into the mapping services for more accessible navigation. Users can choose to use the built-in speaker or Bluetooth for voice feedback. Users can also pair their phone with the intelligent cane via Bluetooth to control their phone. The above-ground The built-in ultrasound sensor detects an above-ground obstacle. The detected obstacle is projected back to the user in the form of vibration or audio, depending on the user\u2019s preferences. Wewalk also has an application where users can view their transit options, such as nearby bus stops and the timetable, and then navigate them to the desired stop. The application also has a built-in voice assistant for more straightforward navigation through the application. If a user loses their phone or cane, they can play a sound on each of them to locate the position of the lost device. Figure 7 shows the WeWalk Smart Cane that is currently on the market.\nLimitation:\n\u2022\tThe device is very expansive, with the price of 500 USD\n\u2022\tRain or snow might cause malfunction on the smart cane and the speaker\n\u2022\tThe tip of the cane is loud when navigating rough surface sidewalk\n2.3.2.3.\tDevelopment of an Intelligent Cane for Visually Impaired Human Subjects\n\tAsati et al., (2019) designed an intelligent white cane that uses HR-SO4 ultrasonic sensors to identify obstacles within a range of 450 meters and determine the distance. The object above head level will also be detected, as the sensors' range is 450 meters. The warning signal is returned in beeping signals via a buzzer, advising the user to take prompt action. Object detection and classification are done utilizing the intelligent technique. The photos are recorded using the web camera for classification. They will be transformed into text and an audio signal for text-to-speech conversion. Figure 8 shows the prototype of this paper's intelligent cane.\nLimitation:\n\u2022\tCost of building the system is high\n\u2022\tUnable to identify pot holes\n\u2022\tDetection under rainy weather is not tested\n\u2003\n2.3.3.\tHandheld\n2.3.3.1.\tAndroid Application for Object Recognition Using Neural Networks for the Visually Impaired\n\tDosi et al. (2018) have developed an Android application that aids the visually impaired with real-time object recognition using the phone's camera and provides feedback by speaking the recognised object. They opted for a deep learning strategy based on a convolutional neural network for improved recognition and faster response times. MobileNets is utilised because it is ideal for mobile and embedded vision applications. Figure 9 shows the results of the detected object using the object recognition application.\nLimitation:\n\u2022\tOnly works offline\n\u2022\tUnknown or untrained objects will be predicted using existing images in the database\n\u2022\tHave to retrain model for untrained object\n2.3.3.2.\tDesign and Implementation of an Embedded Real-Time System for Guiding Visually Impaired Individuals\n\tDuman et al. (2019) have developed and implemented a portable gadget that detects objects and measures their distance precisely to enable visually impaired individuals to see objects and people around them. The device uses YOLO, a convolutional neural network-based real-time identification method with a single device attached to a Raspberry Pi board. The estimated object distance will be projected in audio form to visually challenged users. The accuracy of this detected distance estimation is 98.8%. Initially, the footage is captured using a handheld Raspberry Pi camera. Afterwards, the object detection module executes YOLO for real-time object recognition, and bounding box size extraction for humans is needed. The size of the bounding box is provided to the distance estimation module to determine the distance of the detected individual. The labels of detected objects and the approximated distance of any individual caught are stored temporarily. An audio generation module translates text-based saved results into audio alerts that visually challenged users can listen to using headphones. Alerts are played at a predetermined time to reduce noise and ambiguity. Figure 10 shows the block diagram of the paper\u2019s proposed system.\nLimitation:\n\u2022\tOnly detect humans\n\u2022\tNo design for any wearable option\u2003\n2.3.3.3.\tReal-time object detection and face recognition system to assist the visually impaired\n\tAnish Aralikatti et al. (2020) developed an android application that used the phone camera for real-time object and face detection using OpenCV, the You only live once (YOLO) algorithm and FaceNet. Detection of objects and human will be presented in an audio format to the user. OpenCV is used for real-time computer vision tasks. Since it is implemented into an android phone, they chose Tiny YOLO as it is a lightweight YOLO framework perfect for embedded and mobile devices.

S-glass is a higher-strength variant of E-glass, often used in high-performance applications where exceptional strength and stiffness are required.\nE-glass fibers are made from a specific type of glass containing alumina (Al2O3) and silica (SiO2) as major components. The addition of other elements, such as barium (Ba) and sodium (Na), improves the glass's properties, particularly its electrical resistivity and resistance to water.\nThe manufacturing process for E-glass fibers typically involves:\n1.

The answer lies in the process of how insurance companies determine medical necessity and coverage.

The system is operable in both indoor and outdoor settings. Due to their ample information, lightweight nature, and low cost compared to other sensors, such as ultrasonic and LiDAR sensors, computer vision technologies were integrated into this device's routing and detection capabilities.

(2016) created a system that took video input from a portable camera. They streamed it to a server for real-time image recognition processing using the You Only Live Once (YOLO) model. The 3D location of the discovered object is derived by using the location and size of the object detection algorithm's bounding boxes. The Unity game engine will send it as 3D audio into their attached wireless earphones. The next sound output interval will be in a few seconds or when a different object is detected, whichever occurs first. The solution could conduct precise real-time objective detection with a live stream at a pace of 30 frames per second in 1080p resolution by utilising the YOLO algorithm and an enhanced wireless transmitter. Figure 4 shows the data flow pipeline of the paper\u2019s system. The video footage is captured and sent to the YOLO algorithm for detecting object. The detected object is then send to the earbuds using the unity engine. Figure 5 shows the prototype of the device of this paper.\nLimitation:\n\u2022\tCan only accurately detect and classify object within 2 to 5 meters away\n\u2022\tSurrounding ambient will be block when using earbuds\n\u2022\tToo much information will be sent to user when camera detect multiple objects\n2.3.2.\tSmart Cane\n2.3.2.1.\tSmart Electronic Stick for Visually Impaired using Android Application and Google\u2019s Cloud Vision\n\tThe e-stick module, integrated with a voice-controlled Android application, was designed by Bharatia et al. (2019) to replace the essential simple navigation stick that visually impaired individuals typically use. The e-stick is similar to a standard stick in that it is thin, lightweight, and easy to handle, but it has additional features. Using efficient natural language processing (NLP) features makes these functionalities affordable and possible. The e-stick uses ultrasonic sensors to find low-lying and knee-level obstacles and potholes when moving backwards. Using buzzers, active input on the presence of barriers will be delivered. For Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation to function, the user's phone will be Bluetooth-connected to the stick's circuit. In unavoidable circumstances, the live location of visually impaired individuals will be transmitted to the nearest help centre or their family for assistance. Face detection will be added so that users can tell who is trying to talk to them. With the cloud vision API, it is also possible to translate traffic lights and roadside signs so that blind people can find their way. Text recognition will also be available from photos, making it easy for people to read books, documents, newspapers, and other printed materials. A stick-tracking device has also been built in case the person loses his or her stick. These capabilities will be enabled through hardware (smart stick) and a software module (an Android application). Using Natural Language Processing technology, the user will tell these modules what to do by using voice commands. The e-stick will be charged as needed using a rechargeable circuit. Figure 6 shows how the technologies used in this paper interact.\nLimitation:\n\u2022\tCoverage of obstacle detection is short as it is using sensor\n\u2022\tOnly suitable for indoor\n2.3.2.2.\tWeWalk\n\tWeWalk is a smart cane developed by a non-profit organisation called YGA (WeWALK Smart Cane \u2013 Smart Cane for the Visually Impaired, 2020). WeWalk looks like a traditional-looking cane, but the handle has a built-in touchpad. Users can navigate, save and discover places using the cane via the respected application. Particular layers are built into the mapping services for more accessible navigation. Users can choose to use the built-in speaker or Bluetooth for voice feedback. Users can also pair their phone with the intelligent cane via Bluetooth to control their phone. The above-ground The built-in ultrasound sensor detects an above-ground obstacle. The detected obstacle is projected back to the user in the form of vibration or audio, depending on the user\u2019s preferences. Wewalk also has an application where users can view their transit options, such as nearby bus stops and the timetable, and then navigate them to the desired stop. The application also has a built-in voice assistant for more straightforward navigation through the application. If a user loses their phone or cane, they can play a sound on each of them to locate the position of the lost device. Figure 7 shows the WeWalk Smart Cane that is currently on the market.\nLimitation:\n\u2022\tThe device is very expansive, with the price of 500 USD\n\u2022\tRain or snow might cause malfunction on the smart cane and the speaker\n\u2022\tThe tip of the cane is loud when navigating rough surface sidewalk\n2.3.2.3.\tDevelopment of an Intelligent Cane for Visually Impaired Human Subjects\n\tAsati et al., (2019) designed an intelligent white cane that uses HR-SO4 ultrasonic sensors to identify obstacles within a range of 450 meters and determine the distance. The object above head level will also be detected, as the sensors' range is 450 meters. The warning signal is returned in beeping signals via a buzzer, advising the user to take prompt action. Object detection and classification are done utilizing the intelligent technique. The photos are recorded using the web camera for classification. They will be transformed into text and an audio signal for text-to-speech conversion. Figure 8 shows the prototype of this paper's intelligent cane.\nLimitation:\n\u2022\tCost of building the system is high\n\u2022\tUnable to identify pot holes\n\u2022\tDetection under rainy weather is not tested\n2.3.3.\tHandheld\n2.3.3.1.\tAndroid Application for Object Recognition Using Neural Networks for the Visually Impaired\n\tDosi et al. (2018) have developed an Android application that aids the visually impaired with real-time object recognition using the phone's camera and provides feedback by speaking the recognised object. They opted for a deep learning strategy based on a convolutional neural network for improved recognition and faster response times. MobileNets is utilised because it is ideal for mobile and embedded vision applications. Figure 9 shows the results of the detected object using the object recognition application.\nLimitation:\n\u2022\tOnly works offline\n\u2022\tUnknown or untrained objects will be predicted using existing images in the database\n\u2022\tHave to retrain model for untrained object\n2.3.3.2.\tDesign and Implementation of an Embedded Real-Time System for Guiding Visually Impaired Individuals\n\tDuman et al. (2019) have developed and implemented a portable gadget that detects objects and measures their distance precisely to enable visually impaired individuals to see objects and people around them. The device uses YOLO, a convolutional neural network-based real-time identification method with a single device attached to a Raspberry Pi board. The estimated object distance will be projected in audio form to visually challenged users. The accuracy of this detected distance estimation is 98.8%. Initially, the footage is captured using a handheld Raspberry Pi camera. Afterwards, the object detection module executes YOLO for real-time object recognition, and bounding box size extraction for humans is needed. The size of the bounding box is provided to the distance estimation module to determine the distance of the detected individual. The labels of detected objects and the approximated distance of any individual caught are stored temporarily. An audio generation module translates text-based saved results into audio alerts that visually challenged users can listen to using headphones. Alerts are played at a predetermined time to reduce noise and ambiguity. Figure 10 shows the block diagram of the paper\u2019s proposed system.\nLimitation:\n\u2022\tOnly detect humans\n\u2022\tNo design for any wearable option\u2003\n2.3.3.3.\tReal-time object detection and face recognition system to assist the visually impaired\n\tAnish Aralikatti et al. (2020) developed an android application that used the phone camera for real-time object and face detection using OpenCV, the You only live once (YOLO) algorithm and FaceNet. Detection of objects and human will be presented in an audio format to the user. OpenCV is used for real-time computer vision tasks. Since it is implemented into an android phone, they chose Tiny YOLO as it is a lightweight YOLO framework perfect for embedded and mobile devices. FaceNet is used for face identification systems as it can extract high-quality features of the face. Figure 12 shows the sample outputs of using the android application on a mobile phone. Figure 11 shows the face recognition feature of the android application.\nLimitation: Less accuracy than YOLO as Tiny YOLO model is smaller (Anish Aralikatti et al., 2020)", "response": "\u2003\n\n\n\nThe presentation will cover the previous work of Visual Assistive Technology, focusing on head wear, smart canes, and handheld devices.

From the melting of polar ice caps to droughts and heatwaves, the consequences of climate change are far-reaching and alarming.\nIt\u2019s time for world leaders to prioritize the well-being of the planet and its inhabitants. Implementing policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transitioning to renewable energy sources are just a few steps that can be taken to mitigate the effects of climate change.\nIgnoring the signs of climate change is not only a moral failing but also a catastrophic mistake.

(2018) have developed an Android application that aids the visually impaired with real-time object recognition using the phone's camera and provides feedback by speaking the recognised object. They opted for a deep learning strategy based on a convolutional neural network for improved recognition and faster response times.

(2019) have developed and implemented a portable gadget that detects objects and measures their distance precisely to enable visually impaired individuals to see objects and people around them. The device uses YOLO, a convolutional neural network-based real-time identification method with a single device attached to a Raspberry Pi board. The estimated object distance will be projected in audio form to visually challenged users. The accuracy of this detected distance estimation is 98.8%. Initially, the footage is captured using a handheld Raspberry Pi camera. Afterwards, the object detection module executes YOLO for real-time object recognition, and bounding box size extraction for humans is needed. The size of the bounding box is provided to the distance estimation module to determine the distance of the detected individual. The labels of detected objects and the approximated distance of any individual caught are stored temporarily. An audio generation module translates text-based saved results into audio alerts that visually challenged users can listen to using headphones. Alerts are played at a predetermined time to reduce noise and ambiguity.

Detection of objects and human will be presented in an audio format to the user. OpenCV is used for real-time computer vision tasks. Since it is implemented into an android phone, they chose Tiny YOLO as it is a lightweight YOLO framework perfect for embedded and mobile devices. FaceNet is used for face identification systems as it can extract high-quality features of the face. Figure 12 shows the sample outputs of using the android application on a mobile phone.

Also their way to work, makes them a great partner.\n1) The training is made of 62k enzymatic reactions from a few hundreds enzymes and it's relatively a small number, hence the confidence rate is - in my opinion - relatively partial. If the confidence is low, or even very low (10E-7) then you have three reasons: a) the biodegradation is not possible in this world, b) the training model never saw this substrate (e.g. PVOH), c) the polymer doesn't breakdown according the hypotesis that Teo and his team defined (see action point ii.). In the case of b) I discussed offline with Teo about to integrate a metric that defines the knowledge amount of a given substrate in order to make the interpretation easier.\n2) The degradation polymer reaction might not be correct, because Teodoro supposed that the polymer breaks down into monomers. If it's not the case, then we need to retest with the right assumption. Right assumptions are expected from Nestle team and Otto from MIT.\n\n\nvery positive thing: if there are data for CLASSIFIED (very important) enzymes that are currently not included in the training set, maybe more specific for the training set (i.e. biodegradation vs glucose split), then a transfer learning could help a lot. \nnext steps are two: \ni. for Nestl\u00e9 to dig into what above, so finding new characterised enzymes and moving forward with the integration (transfer learning) into the current IBM model. The ideal and quicker way to do it is to send any private database you can get access to as it follows: POLYMER X + EC ( X.Y.Z.W. ) -> MONOMER1 + MONOMER2. \nii.

Examples of popular websites that use Git include GitHub and GitLab.GitHub Action: GitHub Actions is a tool that allows you to automate your software development workflows directly in your GitHub repository. For example, you could use GitHub Actions to automatically run tests and deploy code to a staging or production environment every time you push new commits to the repository.CircleCI: CircleCI is a continuous integration and delivery platform. It is used to automate the building, testing, and deployment of code changes. For example, CircleCI can be configured to run tests and build a Docker container when code is pushed to a repository, and then deploy the container to a Kubernetes cluster.CI/CD: CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. It is a development practice where code changes are automatically built, tested, and deployed to production. CircleCI, for example, provide tools for CI/CDDocker: Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running distributed applications. It allows developers to package their applications and dependencies into a container, which can then be run on any host with the Docker runtime. For example, a developer could use Docker to package a Python web application and its dependencies into a container, and then run the container on a server in a production environment.Kubernetes: Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It can work with multiple container runtimes, such as Docker. For example, a developer can use Kubernetes to deploy and manage a fleet of Docker containers running a microservice-based application.Grafana: Grafana is an open-source tool for creating and viewing metrics and analytics for applications. it can be integrated with various data sources, including Prometheus, InfluxDB, Graphite, and Elasticsearch. For example, you can use Grafana to monitor the resource usage of a Kubernetes cluster and display this information in a dashboard that can be accessed by the development and operations teams.AI LifeCycle: AI LifeCycle management is a set of practices to develop, deploy and maintain AI/ML models. It covers a wide range of stages, including data collection, cleaning, modeling, and evaluation, deployment, monitoring, and maintenance. For example, you can use a AI LifeCycle to train a machine learning model to predict customer churn, and then deploy the model in a production environment, where it can be used to make predictions in real-time.what are the things to do after ML model deploymentAfter deploying a machine learning (ML) model, there are a few key things that should be done in order to ensure that the model is working as expected and to maintain it over time:Monitor the model's performance: Regularly track the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Compare the model's performance on different subsets of the data, and monitor the performance over time to ensure that it is not degrading.Monitor the model's input data: Watch the data that the model is processing and ensure that it is being fed with the correct and appropriate data. Keep an eye out for any data drift, which can occur when the distribution of the input data changes over time.Retrain the model: Over time, the model's performance may degrade, especially if the input data distribution changes. In this case, the model will need to be retrained and redeployed.Check for bias: Regularly check for bias in the model's predictions. Make sure that the model is treating all groups in the population fairly.Update and version: Keep track of model version and update them accordingly.Audit and compliance: Make sure that the model is compliant with any relevant regulations or industry standards.Implement feedback loop: Implement a feedback mechanism that allows customers or end-users to provide feedback on the model's performance.Continous evaluation: Continuously evaluate and monitor model performance, retrain and adjust models as needed.By regularly monitoring the model's performance and retraining the model when necessary, you can help ensure that the model stays accurate and continues to provide valuable predictions over time.", "response": " Additionally, you should also consider the following:Automate monitoring and maintenance tasks: Use tools like Grafana, Prometheus, and Alertmanager to automate monitoring and maintenance tasks and make sure the model is performing as expected.Deploy additional resources: As the model grows, you may need to deploy additional resources, like more nodes or higher capacity instances, to ensure the model can scale with demand.Ensure data quality: Make sure data used to train and maintain the model is accurate, complete, and consistent.Enforce data governance: Define and enforce policies around data usage, storage, and access to ensure compliance with regulations and company policies.who can use these toolsAny developer, data scientist, or engineer working with machine learning models and deploying them to production environments can use these tools. They are useful for a variety of tasks, including:Developers: Use GitHub Actions, CircleCI, and Docker to automate testing, building, and deployment of code.Data scientists: Use AI LifeCycle management and machine learning libraries like TensorFlow", "tokens": 200, "duration": 31.868951559066772}

The system is operable in both indoor and outdoor settings. Due to their ample information, lightweight nature, and low cost compared to other sensors, such as ultrasonic and LiDAR sensors, computer vision technologies were integrated into this device's routing and detection capabilities. The smartphone does the process of detecting and routing, and the feedback is sent to the user's ear through an earphone plugged into the smartphone (Bai et al., 2019).\nLimitation:\n\u2022\tWeak in detecting small-size obstacle\n\u2022\tStaircase detection is not implemented\u2003\n2.3.1.2.\tLet Blind People See: Real-Time Visual Recognition with Results Converted to 3D Audio\nJiang et al. (2016) created a system that took video input from a portable camera. They streamed it to a server for real-time image recognition processing using the You Only Live Once (YOLO) model. The 3D location of the discovered object is derived by using the location and size of the object detection algorithm's bounding boxes. The Unity game engine will send it as 3D audio into their attached wireless earphones. The next sound output interval will be in a few seconds or when a different object is detected, whichever occurs first. The solution could conduct precise real-time objective detection with a live stream at a pace of 30 frames per second in 1080p resolution by utilising the YOLO algorithm and an enhanced wireless transmitter. Figure 4 shows the data flow pipeline of the paper\u2019s system. The video footage is captured and sent to the YOLO algorithm for detecting object. The detected object is then send to the earbuds using the unity engine. Figure 5 shows the prototype of the device of this paper.\nLimitation:\n\u2022\tCan only accurately detect and classify object within 2 to 5 meters away\n\u2022\tSurrounding ambient will be block when using earbuds\n\u2022\tToo much information will be sent to user when camera detect multiple objects\n\n2.3.2.\tSmart Cane\n2.3.2.1.\tSmart Electronic Stick for Visually Impaired using Android Application and Google\u2019s Cloud Vision\nThe e-stick module, integrated with a voice-controlled Android application, was designed by Bharatia et al. (2019) to replace the essential simple navigation stick that visually impaired individuals typically use. The e-stick is similar to a standard stick in that it is thin, lightweight, and easy to handle, but it has additional features. Using efficient natural language processing (NLP) features makes these functionalities affordable and possible. The e-stick uses ultrasonic sensors to find low-lying and knee-level obstacles and potholes when moving backwards. Using buzzers, active input on the presence of barriers will be delivered. For Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation to function, the user's phone will be Bluetooth-connected to the stick's circuit. In unavoidable circumstances, the live location of visually impaired individuals will be transmitted to the nearest help centre or their family for assistance. Face detection will be added so that users can tell who is trying to talk to them. With the cloud vision API, it is also possible to translate traffic lights and roadside signs so that blind people can find their way. Text recognition will also be available from photos, making it easy for people to read books, documents, newspapers, and other printed materials. A stick-tracking device has also been built in case the person loses his or her stick. These capabilities will be enabled through hardware (smart stick) and a software module (an Android application). Using Natural Language Processing technology, the user will tell these modules what to do by using voice commands. The e-stick will be charged as needed using a rechargeable circuit. Figure 6 shows how the technologies used in this paper interact.\nLimitation:\n\u2022\tCoverage of obstacle detection is short as it is using sensor\n\u2022\tOnly suitable for indoor\n2.3.2.2.\tWeWalkWeWalk is a smart cane developed by a non-profit organisation called YGA (WeWALK Smart Cane \u2013 Smart Cane for the Visually Impaired, 2020). WeWalk looks like a traditional-looking cane, but the handle has a built-in touchpad. Users can navigate, save and discover places using the cane via the respected application. Particular layers are built into the mapping services for more accessible navigation. Users can choose to use the built-in speaker or Bluetooth for voice feedback. Users can also pair their phone with the intelligent cane via Bluetooth to control their phone. The above-ground The built-in ultrasound sensor detects an above-ground obstacle. The detected obstacle is projected back to the user in the form of vibration or audio, depending on the user\u2019s preferences. Wewalk also has an application where users can view their transit options, such as nearby bus stops and the timetable, and then navigate them to the desired stop. The application also has a built-in voice assistant for more straightforward navigation through the application. If a user loses their phone or cane, they can play a sound on each of them to locate the position of the lost device. Figure 7 shows the WeWalk Smart Cane that is currently on the market.\nLimitation:\n\u2022\tThe device is very expansive, with the price of 500 USD\n\u2022\tRain or snow might cause malfunction on the smart cane and the speaker\n\u2022\tThe tip of the cane is loud when navigating rough surface sidewalk\n2.3.2.3.\tDevelopment of an Intelligent Cane for Visually Impaired Human Subjects\n\tAsati et al., (2019) designed an intelligent white cane that uses HR-SO4 ultrasonic sensors to identify obstacles within a range of 450 meters and determine the distance. The object above head level will also be detected, as the sensors' range is 450 meters. The warning signal is returned in beeping signals via a buzzer, advising the user to take prompt action. Object detection and classification are done utilizing the intelligent technique. The photos are recorded using the web camera for classification. They will be transformed into text and an audio signal for text-to-speech conversion. Figure 8 shows the prototype of this paper's intelligent cane.\nLimitation:\n\u2022\tCost of building the system is high\n\u2022\tUnable to identify pot holes\n\u2022\tDetection under rainy weather is not tested\n2.3.3.\tHandheld\n2.3.3.1.\tAndroid Application for Object Recognition Using Neural Networks for the Visually Impaired\n\tDosi et al. (2018) have developed an Android application that aids the visually impaired with real-time object recognition using the phone's camera and provides feedback by speaking the recognised object. They opted for a deep learning strategy based on a convolutional neural network for improved recognition and faster response times. MobileNets is utilised because it is ideal for mobile and embedded vision applications. Figure 9 shows the results of the detected object using the object recognition application.\nLimitation:\n\u2022\tOnly works offline\n\u2022\tUnknown or untrained objects will be predicted using existing images in the database\n\u2022\tHave to retrain model for untrained object\n2.3.3.2.\tDesign and Implementation of an Embedded Real-Time System for Guiding Visually Impaired Individuals\n\tDuman et al. (2019) have developed and implemented a portable gadget that detects objects and measures their distance precisely to enable visually impaired individuals to see objects and people around them. The device uses YOLO, a convolutional neural network-based real-time identification method with a single device attached to a Raspberry Pi board. The estimated object distance will be projected in audio form to visually challenged users. The accuracy of this detected distance estimation is 98.8%. Initially, the footage is captured using a handheld Raspberry Pi camera. Afterwards, the object detection module executes YOLO for real-time object recognition, and bounding box size extraction for humans is needed. The size of the bounding box is provided to the distance estimation module to determine the distance of the detected individual. The labels of detected objects and the approximated distance of any individual caught are stored temporarily. An audio generation module translates text-based saved results into audio alerts that visually challenged users can listen to using headphones. Alerts are played at a predetermined time to reduce noise and ambiguity. Figure 10 shows the block diagram of the paper\u2019s proposed system.\nLimitation:\n\u2022\tOnly detect humans\n\u2022\tNo design for any wearable option\u2003\n2.3.3.3.\tReal-time object detection and face recognition system to assist the visually impaired\n\tAnish Aralikatti et al. (2020) developed an android application that used the phone camera for real-time object and face detection using OpenCV, the You only live once (YOLO) algorithm and FaceNet. Detection of objects and human will be presented in an audio format to the user. OpenCV is used for real-time computer vision tasks. Since it is implemented into an android phone, they chose Tiny YOLO as it is a lightweight YOLO framework perfect for embedded and mobile devices. FaceNet is used for face identification systems as it can extract high-quality features of the face. Figure 12 shows the sample outputs of using the android application on a mobile phone. Figure 11 shows the face recognition feature of the android application.\nLimitation: Less accuracy than YOLO as Tiny YOLO model is smaller (Anish Aralikatti et al., 2020)", "response": "\u2003\n\nThis chapter discusses various previous works of and current technologies in the area of Visual Assistive Technology, focusing on smart devices and tools designed for visually impaired individuals.

Early birds, on the other hand, tend to go to bed earlier and wake up earlier, often to start their day early and get things done before the rest of the world wakes up.\nThe difference between night owls and early birds may be influenced by genetics, as some research suggests that there may be specific genetic variants that influence circadian rhythms and the sleep-wake cycle.

The system is operable in both indoor and outdoor settings. Due to their ample information, lightweight nature, and low cost compared to other sensors, such as ultrasonic and LiDAR sensors, computer vision technologies were integrated into this device's routing and detection capabilities. The smartphone does the process of detecting and routing, and the feedback is sent to the user's ear through an earphone plugged into the smartphone (Bai et al., 2019).\nLimitation:\n\u2022\tWeak in detecting small-size obstacle\n\u2022\tStaircase detection is not implemented\u2003\n\n2.3.1.2.\tLet Blind People See: Real-Time Visual Recognition with Results Converted to 3D Audio\nJiang et al. (2016) created a system that took video input from a portable camera. They streamed it to a server for real-time image recognition processing using the You Only Live Once (YOLO) model. The 3D location of the discovered object is derived by using the location and size of the object detection algorithm's bounding boxes. The Unity game engine will send it as 3D audio into their attached wireless earphones. The next sound output interval will be in a few seconds or when a different object is detected, whichever occurs first. The solution could conduct precise real-time objective detection with a live stream at a pace of 30 frames per second in 1080p resolution by utilising the YOLO algorithm and an enhanced wireless transmitter. Figure 4 shows the data flow pipeline of the paper\u2019s system. The video footage is captured and sent to the YOLO algorithm for detecting object. The detected object is then send to the earbuds using the unity engine. Figure 5 shows the prototype of the device of this paper.\nLimitation:\n\u2022\tCan only accurately detect and classify object within 2 to 5 meters away\n\u2022\tSurrounding ambient will be block when using earbuds\n\u2022\tToo much information will be sent to user when camera detect multiple objects\n\n2.3.2.\tSmart Cane\n2.3.2.1.\tSmart Electronic Stick for Visually Impaired using Android Application and Google\u2019s Cloud Vision\nThe e-stick module, integrated with a voice-controlled Android application, was designed by Bharatia et al. (2019) to replace the essential simple navigation stick that visually impaired individuals typically use. The e-stick is similar to a standard stick in that it is thin, lightweight, and easy to handle, but it has additional features. Using efficient natural language processing (NLP) features makes these functionalities affordable and possible. The e-stick uses ultrasonic sensors to find low-lying and knee-level obstacles and potholes when moving backwards. Using buzzers, active input on the presence of barriers will be delivered. For Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation to function, the user's phone will be Bluetooth-connected to the stick's circuit. In unavoidable circumstances, the live location of visually impaired individuals will be transmitted to the nearest help centre or their family for assistance. Face detection will be added so that users can tell who is trying to talk to them. With the cloud vision API, it is also possible to translate traffic lights and roadside signs so that blind people can find their way. Text recognition will also be available from photos, making it easy for people to read books, documents, newspapers, and other printed materials. A stick-tracking device has also been built in case the person loses his or her stick. These capabilities will be enabled through hardware (smart stick) and a software module (an Android application). Using Natural Language Processing technology, the user will tell these modules what to do by using voice commands. The e-stick will be charged as needed using a rechargeable circuit. Figure 6 shows how the technologies used in this paper interact.\nLimitation:\n\u2022\tCoverage of obstacle detection is short as it is using sensor\n\u2022\tOnly suitable for indoor\n\n2.3.2.2.\tWeWalkWeWalk is a smart cane developed by a non-profit organisation called YGA (WeWALK Smart Cane \u2013 Smart Cane for the Visually Impaired, 2020). WeWalk looks like a traditional-looking cane, but the handle has a built-in touchpad. Users can navigate, save and discover places using the cane via the respected application. Particular layers are built into the mapping services for more accessible navigation. Users can choose to use the built-in speaker or Bluetooth for voice feedback. Users can also pair their phone with the intelligent cane via Bluetooth to control their phone. The above-ground The built-in ultrasound sensor detects an above-ground obstacle. The detected obstacle is projected back to the user in the form of vibration or audio, depending on the user\u2019s preferences. Wewalk also has an application where users can view their transit options, such as nearby bus stops and the timetable, and then navigate them to the desired stop. The application also has a built-in voice assistant for more straightforward navigation through the application. If a user loses their phone or cane, they can play a sound on each of them to locate the position of the lost device. Figure 7 shows the WeWalk Smart Cane that is currently on the market.\nLimitation:\n\u2022\tThe device is very expansive, with the price of 500 USD\n\u2022\tRain or snow might cause malfunction on the smart cane and the speaker\n\u2022\tThe tip of the cane is loud when navigating rough surface sidewalk\n\n2.3.2.3.\tDevelopment of an Intelligent Cane for Visually Impaired Human Subjects\nAsati et al., (2019) designed an intelligent white cane that uses HR-SO4 ultrasonic sensors to identify obstacles within a range of 450 meters and determine the distance. The object above head level will also be detected, as the sensors' range is 450 meters. The warning signal is returned in beeping signals via a buzzer, advising the user to take prompt action. Object detection and classification are done utilizing the intelligent technique. The photos are recorded using the web camera for classification. They will be transformed into text and an audio signal for text-to-speech conversion. Figure 8 shows the prototype of this paper's intelligent cane.\nLimitation:\n\u2022\tCost of building the system is high\n\u2022\tUnable to identify pot holes\n\u2022\tDetection under rainy weather is not tested\n\n2.3.3.\tHandheld\n\n2.3.3.1.\tAndroid Application for Object Recognition Using Neural Networks for the Visually Impaired\nDosi et al. (2018) have developed an Android application that aids the visually impaired with real-time object recognition using the phone's camera and provides feedback by speaking the recognised object. They opted for a deep learning strategy based on a convolutional neural network for improved recognition and faster response times. MobileNets is utilised because it is ideal for mobile and embedded vision applications. Figure 9 shows the results of the detected object using the object recognition application.\nLimitation:\n\u2022\tOnly works offline\n\u2022\tUnknown or untrained objects will be predicted using existing images in the database\n\u2022\tHave to retrain model for untrained object\n\n2.3.3.2.\tDesign and Implementation of an Embedded Real-Time System for Guiding Visually Impaired Individuals\nDuman et al. (2019) have developed and implemented a portable gadget that detects objects and measures their distance precisely to enable visually impaired individuals to see objects and people around them. The device uses YOLO, a convolutional neural network-based real-time identification method with a single device attached to a Raspberry Pi board. The estimated object distance will be projected in audio form to visually challenged users. The accuracy of this detected distance estimation is 98.8%. Initially, the footage is captured using a handheld Raspberry Pi camera. Afterwards, the object detection module executes YOLO for real-time object recognition, and bounding box size extraction for humans is needed. The size of the bounding box is provided to the distance estimation module to determine the distance of the detected individual. The labels of detected objects and the approximated distance of any individual caught are stored temporarily. An audio generation module translates text-based saved results into audio alerts that visually challenged users can listen to using headphones. Alerts are played at a predetermined time to reduce noise and ambiguity.

(2020) developed an android application that used the phone camera for real-time object and face detection using OpenCV, the You only live once (YOLO) algorithm and FaceNet. Detection of objects and human will be presented in an audio format to the user. OpenCV is used for real-time computer vision tasks. Since it is implemented into an android phone, they chose Tiny YOLO as it is a lightweight YOLO framework perfect for embedded and mobile devices. FaceNet is used for face identification systems as it can extract high-quality features of the face. Figure 12 shows the sample outputs of using the android application on a mobile phone. Figure 11 shows the face recognition feature of the android application.\nLimitation: Less accuracy than YOLO as Tiny YOLO model is smaller (Anish Aralikatti et al., 2020)", "response": " \n\n2.3.4.\tOther Assistive Devices\n2.3.4.1.\tContactless Mobile System for Visually Impaired Individuals\nRahul P. Singh et al. (2015) created a contactless mobile system, called the \"smart screen reader,\" using a smartphone that can automatically read out text on a PC screen. They used a smartphone's camera to obtain a snapshot of the text on the screen, then the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) algorithm was used to identify the character. The text was then read out to the visually impaired user using the phone's audio speaker. This system may be used in areas where the visually impaired individual is unable to access a screen reader.

We've got the inside scoop.\nEarly stage VCs, also known as seed or startup VCs, are investors who focus on providing funding to startups in their early stages of development, typically before they have gained significant traction or revenue. These VCs usually invest between $100,000 to $5 million or more, depending on the stage and potential of the startup.\nSo, what are early stage VCs looking for in a startup? Here are the key factors:\n1. **Unique Value Proposition (UVP)**: A strong, competitive UVP is essential. Your startup must offer a compelling solution that addresses a genuine need in the market.\n2. **Market Potential**: Early stage VCs want to see a large, addressable market with significant growth potential.

An idiom is an expression that means something different than the literal meaning of the words. Idioms are often used in everyday language and are commonly found in literature and culture. They are used to add flavor and interest to writing and speech. Here are some examples of common idioms: \u201cbreak a leg,\u201d \u201craining cats and dogs,\u201d \u201cbend over backwards,\u201d \u201cburn the midnight oil,\u201d and \u201cbeat around the bush.\u201d Idioms can be used to describe people, places, events, or situations in a creative and memorable way.\nUse idioms in your writing and speech to make it more engaging and interesting. Idioms can help you convey complex ideas and emotions in a simple and effective way. For example, you could say \u201cI'm feeling under the weather\u201d instead of \u201cI'm sick,\u201d or \u201cI'm burning the midnight oil\u201d instead of \u201cI'm working late.\u201d Idioms can add a touch of humor, creativity, and personality to your writing and speech", "tokens": 200, "duration": 32.45640993118286}

We added support for embedding SVGs recently, but sometimes you want to keep your diagrams up to date with your docs and create something as easily as doing ASCII art, but a lot prettier.\n\nEnter Mermaid \ud83e\udddc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udddc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\nMermaid is a JavaScript based diagramming and charting tool that takes Markdown-inspired text definitions and creates diagrams dynamically in the browser. Maintained by Knut Sveidqvist, it supports a bunch of different common diagram types for software projects, including flowcharts, UML, Git graphs, user journey diagrams, and even the dreaded Gantt chart.\n\nWorking with Knut and also the wider community at CommonMark, we\u2019ve rolled out a change that will allow you to create graphs inline using Mermaid syntax, for example:\n\n```mermaid\n  graph TD;\n      A-->B;\n      A-->C;\n      B-->D;\n      C-->D;\n```\nThe raw code block above will appear as this diagram in the rendered Markdown:\n\nrendered diagram example\n\nHow it works\nWhen we encounter code blocks marked as mermaid, we generate an iframe that takes the raw Mermaid syntax and passes it to Mermaid.js, turning that code into a diagram in your local browser.\n\nWe achieve this through a two-stage process\u2014GitHub\u2019s HTML pipeline and Viewscreen, our internal file rendering service.\n\nFirst, we add a filter to the HTML pipeline that looks for raw pre tags with the mermaid language designation and substitutes it with a template that works progressively, such that clients requesting content with embedded Mermaid in a non-JavaScript environment (such as an API request) will see the original Markdown code.\n\nNext, assuming the content is viewed in a JavaScript-enabled environment, we inject an iframe into the page, pointing the src attribute to the Viewscreen service. This has several advantages:\n\nIt offloads the library to an external service, keeping the JavaScript payload we need to serve from Rails smaller.\nRendering the charts asynchronously helps eliminate the overhead of potentially rendering several charts before sending the compiled ERB view to the client.\nUser-supplied content is locked away in an iframe, where it has less potential to cause mischief on the GitHub page that the chart is loaded into.\nMermaid pipeline\n\nHere is a visual representation of the path your Mermaid-flavored Markdown takes to become a fully-rendered Mermaid chart. (Here\u2019s the Mermaid code for the diagram.)\n\ndiagram of mermaid\n\nThe net result is fast, easily editable, and vector-based diagrams right in your documentation where you need them.\n\nMermaid has been getting increasingly popular with developers and has a rich community of contributors led by the maintainer Knut Sveidqvist. We are very grateful for Knut\u2019s support in bringing this feature to everyone on GitHub.

It was invented by Kaufman and Rousseeuw in the 1980s. In this algorithm, each cluster is represented by a medoid, which is an object that is representative of its cluster and also typical for the objects in that cluster. Medoids are selected based on a distance function, where the distance between an object and the medoid of its cluster is minimized.\nHere's how k-medoid clustering can help remove duplicates and leave the central sentence out of its duplicates:\n1.  **Preprocessing**: Before applying k-medoid clustering, convert the text corpus to some form of numerical representation, such as TF-IDF vectors. This will allow the algorithm to work with the text data.\n2.  **Clustering**: Apply k-medoid clustering to the preprocessed text data.

The system is operable in both indoor and outdoor settings. Due to their ample information, lightweight nature, and low cost compared to other sensors, such as ultrasonic and LiDAR sensors, computer vision technologies were integrated into this device's routing and detection capabilities. The smartphone does the process of detecting and routing, and the feedback is sent to the user's ear through an earphone plugged into the smartphone (Bai et al., 2019).\nLimitation:\n\u2022\tWeak in detecting small-size obstacle\n\u2022\tStaircase detection is not implemented\u2003\n2.3.1.2.\tLet Blind People See: Real-Time Visual Recognition with Results Converted to 3D Audio\n\tJiang et al. (2016) created a system that took video input from a portable camera. They streamed it to a server for real-time image recognition processing using the You Only Live Once (YOLO) model. The 3D location of the discovered object is derived by using the location and size of the object detection algorithm's bounding boxes. The Unity game engine will send it as 3D audio into their attached wireless earphones. The next sound output interval will be in a few seconds or when a different object is detected, whichever occurs first. The solution could conduct precise real-time objective detection with a live stream at a pace of 30 frames per second in 1080p resolution by utilising the YOLO algorithm and an enhanced wireless transmitter. Figure 4 shows the data flow pipeline of the paper\u2019s system. The video footage is captured and sent to the YOLO algorithm for detecting object. The detected object is then send to the earbuds using the unity engine. Figure 5 shows the prototype of the device of this paper.\nLimitation:\n\u2022\tCan only accurately detect and classify object within 2 to 5 meters away\n\u2022\tSurrounding ambient will be block when using earbuds\n\u2022\tToo much information will be sent to user when camera detect multiple objects\n2.3.2.\tSmart Cane\n2.3.2.1.\tSmart Electronic Stick for Visually Impaired using Android Application and Google\u2019s Cloud Vision\n\tThe e-stick module, integrated with a voice-controlled Android application, was designed by Bharatia et al. (2019) to replace the essential simple navigation stick that visually impaired individuals typically use. The e-stick is similar to a standard stick in that it is thin, lightweight, and easy to handle, but it has additional features. Using efficient natural language processing (NLP) features makes these functionalities affordable and possible. The e-stick uses ultrasonic sensors to find low-lying and knee-level obstacles and potholes when moving backwards. Using buzzers, active input on the presence of barriers will be delivered. For Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation to function, the user's phone will be Bluetooth-connected to the stick's circuit. In unavoidable circumstances, the live location of visually impaired individuals will be transmitted to the nearest help centre or their family for assistance. Face detection will be added so that users can tell who is trying to talk to them. With the cloud vision API, it is also possible to translate traffic lights and roadside signs so that blind people can find their way. Text recognition will also be available from photos, making it easy for people to read books, documents, newspapers, and other printed materials. A stick-tracking device has also been built in case the person loses his or her stick. These capabilities will be enabled through hardware (smart stick) and a software module (an Android application). Using Natural Language Processing technology, the user will tell these modules what to do by using voice commands. The e-stick will be charged as needed using a rechargeable circuit. Figure 6 shows how the technologies used in this paper interact.\nLimitation:\n\u2022\tCoverage of obstacle detection is short as it is using sensor\n\u2022\tOnly suitable for indoor\n2.3.2.2.\tWeWalk\n\tWeWalk is a smart cane developed by a non-profit organisation called YGA (WeWALK Smart Cane \u2013 Smart Cane for the Visually Impaired, 2020). WeWalk looks like a traditional-looking cane, but the handle has a built-in touchpad. Users can navigate, save and discover places using the cane via the respected application. Particular layers are built into the mapping services for more accessible navigation. Users can choose to use the built-in speaker or Bluetooth for voice feedback. Users can also pair their phone with the intelligent cane via Bluetooth to control their phone. The above-ground The built-in ultrasound sensor detects an above-ground obstacle. The detected obstacle is projected back to the user in the form of vibration or audio, depending on the user\u2019s preferences. Wewalk also has an application where users can view their transit options, such as nearby bus stops and the timetable, and then navigate them to the desired stop. The application also has a built-in voice assistant for more straightforward navigation through the application. If a user loses their phone or cane, they can play a sound on each of them to locate the position of the lost device. Figure 7 shows the WeWalk Smart Cane that is currently on the market.\nLimitation:\n\u2022\tThe device is very expansive, with the price of 500 USD\n\u2022\tRain or snow might cause malfunction on the smart cane and the speaker\n\u2022\tThe tip of the cane is loud when navigating rough surface sidewalk\n2.3.2.3.\tDevelopment of an Intelligent Cane for Visually Impaired Human Subjects\n\tAsati et al., (2019) designed an intelligent white cane that uses HR-SO4 ultrasonic sensors to identify obstacles within a range of 450 meters and determine the distance. The object above head level will also be detected, as the sensors' range is 450 meters. The warning signal is returned in beeping signals via a buzzer, advising the user to take prompt action. Object detection and classification are done utilizing the intelligent technique. The photos are recorded using the web camera for classification. They will be transformed into text and an audio signal for text-to-speech conversion. Figure 8 shows the prototype of this paper's intelligent cane.\nLimitation:\n\u2022\tCost of building the system is high\n\u2022\tUnable to identify pot holes\n\u2022\tDetection under rainy weather is not tested\n\u2003\n2.3.3.\tHandheld\n2.3.3.1.\tAndroid Application for Object Recognition Using Neural Networks for the Visually Impaired\n\tDosi et al. (2018) have developed an Android application that aids the visually impaired with real-time object recognition using the phone's camera and provides feedback by speaking the recognised object. They opted for a deep learning strategy based on a convolutional neural network for improved recognition and faster response times. MobileNets is utilised because it is ideal for mobile and embedded vision applications. Figure 9 shows the results of the detected object using the object recognition application.\nLimitation:\n\u2022\tOnly works offline\n\u2022\tUnknown or untrained objects will be predicted using existing images in the database\n\u2022\tHave to retrain model for untrained object\n2.3.3.2.\tDesign and Implementation of an Embedded Real-Time System for Guiding Visually Impaired Individuals\n\tDuman et al. (2019) have developed and implemented a portable gadget that detects objects and measures their distance precisely to enable visually impaired individuals to see objects and people around them. The device uses YOLO, a convolutional neural network-based real-time identification method with a single device attached to a Raspberry Pi board. The estimated object distance will be projected in audio form to visually challenged users. The accuracy of this detected distance estimation is 98.8%. Initially, the footage is captured using a handheld Raspberry Pi camera. Afterwards, the object detection module executes YOLO for real-time object recognition, and bounding box size extraction for humans is needed. The size of the bounding box is provided to the distance estimation module to determine the distance of the detected individual. The labels of detected objects and the approximated distance of any individual caught are stored temporarily. An audio generation module translates text-based saved results into audio alerts that visually challenged users can listen to using headphones. Alerts are played at a predetermined time to reduce noise and ambiguity. Figure 10 shows the block diagram of the paper\u2019s proposed system.\nLimitation:\n\u2022\tOnly detect humans\n\u2022\tNo design for any wearable option\u2003\n2.3.3.3.\tReal-time object detection and face recognition system to assist the visually impaired\n\tAnish Aralikatti et al. (2020) developed an android application that used the phone camera for real-time object and face detection using OpenCV, the You only live once (YOLO) algorithm and FaceNet. Detection of objects and human will be presented in an audio format to the user. OpenCV is used for real-time computer vision tasks. Since it is implemented into an android phone, they chose Tiny YOLO as it is a lightweight YOLO framework perfect for embedded and mobile devices. FaceNet is used for face identification systems as it can extract high-quality features of the face. Figure 12 shows the sample outputs of using the android application on a mobile phone. Figure 11 shows the face recognition feature of the android application.\nLimitation: Less accuracy than YOLO as Tiny YOLO model is smaller (Anish Aralikatti et al., 2020)", "response": "\u2003\nLimitation:\n\u2022\tOnly detect human and objects\n\u2022\tDevice must be in range in order to detect and detect the object\n\u2022\tStill have a lot of noise in the result\n\u2022\tWill require high spec device in order to run the android application smoothly\n2.4.\tPrevious work of Visual Assistive Technology\n2.4.1.\tPrevious work of Handheld\n2.4.1.1.\tAndroid Application for Object Recognition Using Neural Networks for the Visually Impaired\n\tDosi et al.

However, I also think that there are some negative consequences of our reliance on technology.\nFor example, people are spending more and more time staring at screens and less time interacting with the physical world around them. This can lead to social isolation, decreased face-to-face communication, and a lack of physical activity. Additionally, the constant availability of information through social media and the internet can be overwhelming and lead to feelings of anxiety and stress.\nFurthermore, the reliance on technology can also have a negative impact on our mental and physical health.

This can lead to poor grades and difficulties in learning new concepts.\nHyperactivity:\nKids with ADHD often exhibit excessive physical movement, which can manifest as fidgeting, talking excessively, or interrupting others. This can make it challenging for them to sit still, participate in quiet activities, or engage in social interactions.\nImpulsivity:\nImpulsive behaviors, such as blurting out answers, interrupting others, or acting without thinking, can be common in children with ADHD. This can lead to conflicts with peers, teachers, or family members.\nADHD can impact daily life in various ways, including:\n", "tokens": 199, "duration": 32.01094198226929}

Correct it Please if there is something wrong or something better including Grammar.\n\nAs a society continues to evolve, the issues regarding social media has become increasingly relevant. However, this essay argues that social media can still have advantages particularly in the realm of education (or learning). The author doesn't argue that we should go back to online learning modality but rather argue that it can be a helpful tool for learning.\n\nThe essay argues that social media can be an effective tool for students to gather information for research and to access additional information about their studies. It acknowledges that social media can be a convenient and efficient source of information. Yet, the essay also recognizes that social media can also feed too much information to users, and some of it may be inappropriate for students. To sum up, it emphasizes that learners must have discipline to use social media as a learning tool.\n\nThis essay provides a good overview of the advantages and disadvantages of using social media as a tool for learning. However, to make it more effective, there are some areas that need improvement. Firstly, the thesis statement needs to be more specific and detailed. While it mentions that social media can be used for learning, it fails to provide any additional information about the argument or the points that will be made in the essay. Therefore, a clear and concise thesis statement must be added to the end of the introductory paragraph to give readers a better idea of what to expect from the essay. Secondly, the essay lacks a clear and organized structure. It jumps between different ideas and points without always relating them to the main argument. A more focused approach with each paragraph clearly linked to the thesis statement would improve the essay's coherence and make it easier to follow. Thirdly, the writer makes some good points about social media's advantages and disadvantages in learning, but these arguments need to be supported with data and specific examples. This would strengthen the arguments and make the essay more persuasive. Lastly, the conclusion should be more impactful by summarizing the main points, restating the thesis statement, and providing actionable recommendations for using social media as a tool for learning. By making these improvements, the essay would be more persuasive and effective in presenting the pros and cons of using social media for learning.\n\nTo conclude, this essay provides insightful perspectives on the advantages and disadvantages of using social media for learning. To enhance the clarity and impact of its arguments, the essay would benefit from a clearer and more concise thesis statement, a more organized structure, and the inclusion of supporting evidence and data. Furthermore, a stronger conclusion that summarizes the key points and provides actionable recommendations would strengthen the overall effectiveness of the essay. By addressing these areas of improvement, the essay could become a more convincing and influential piece of writing.", "response": " \n\nSome feedback on your critique:\n\n1.

(2019) to replace the essential simple navigation stick that visually impaired individuals typically use. The e-stick is similar to a standard stick in that it is thin, lightweight, and easy to handle, but it has additional features. Using efficient natural language processing (NLP) features makes these functionalities affordable and possible. The e-stick uses ultrasonic sensors to find low-lying and knee-level obstacles and potholes when moving backwards. Using buzzers, active input on the presence of barriers will be delivered. For Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation to function, the user's phone will be Bluetooth-connected to the stick's circuit. In unavoidable circumstances, the live location of visually impaired individuals will be transmitted to the nearest help centre or their family for assistance. Face detection will be added so that users can tell who is trying to talk to them. With the cloud vision API, it is also possible to translate traffic lights and roadside signs so that blind people can find their way. Text recognition will also be available from photos, making it easy for people to read books, documents, newspapers, and other printed materials. A stick-tracking device has also been built in case the person loses his or her stick. These capabilities will be enabled through hardware (smart stick) and a software module (an Android application). Using Natural Language Processing technology, the user will tell these modules what to do by using voice commands. The e-stick will be charged as needed using a rechargeable circuit.

WeWalk looks like a traditional-looking cane, but the handle has a built-in touchpad. Users can navigate, save and discover places using the cane via the respected application. Particular layers are built into the mapping services for more accessible navigation. Users can choose to use the built-in speaker or Bluetooth for voice feedback. Users can also pair their phone with the intelligent cane via Bluetooth to control their phone. The above-ground The built-in ultrasound sensor detects an above-ground obstacle. The detected obstacle is projected back to the user in the form of vibration or audio, depending on the user\u2019s preferences. Wewalk also has an application where users can view their transit options, such as nearby bus stops and the timetable, and then navigate them to the desired stop. The application also has a built-in voice assistant for more straightforward navigation through the application. If a user loses their phone or cane, they can play a sound on each of them to locate the position of the lost device.
