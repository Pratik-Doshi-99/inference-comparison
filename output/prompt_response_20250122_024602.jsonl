Here's a step-by-step explanation of how photosynthesis works:\n\n**Step 1: Light Energy Absorption**\n\nPlants have specialized pigments such as chlorophyll, which absorbs light energy from the sun. Chlorophyll is responsible for absorbing blue and red light, but not green light, which is why it appears green.\n\n**Step 2: Water Absorption**\n\nPlants absorb water from the soil through their roots. This water is transported to the leaves, where photosynthesis takes place.\n\n**Step 3: Carbon Dioxide Absorption**\n\nPlants absorb carbon dioxide from the air through small openings called stomata. This carbon dioxide is used to produce glucose and oxygen.\n\n", "tokens": 199, "duration": 28.782475471496582}

Light Absorption: Plants absorb light energy from the sun through their leaves, which contain pigments such as chlorophyll. Chlorophyll absorbs light in the blue and red parts of the visible spectrum, but reflects light in the green part of the spectrum, which is why it appears green to our eyes.\n2. Light Energy Conversion: The light energy absorbed by chlorophyll is used to drive a series of chemical reactions that convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen.
